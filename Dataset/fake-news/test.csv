"Embroiled in a scandal over his past wearing of blackface and brownface, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau now faces international criticism after new childhood pictures of his brother and him riding on the back of black children during a trip to Kenya.","The Canadian leader who’s actually running for reelection was embarrassed by two pictures and one video showing him wearing racist makeup during the first week of the election campaign. This new picture taken in 1981 by a Kenyan diplomat has stirred outrage around the world, bringing reactions from several Canadian politicians as well as foreign leaders. The leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer, said the recent series of revelations about Justin Trudeau’s past tend to show a “darker and creepier side hidden behind his good-guy image”. Even U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the pictures and the scandal during a press conference this morning. A photo of Justin Trudeau at West Point Grey Academy’s Arabian Nights gala in April 2001 was the first of a series of picture suggesting Trudeau in racially sensible positions revealed over only a few days. Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada since 2015 and he has built his political career around his image of a modern open-minded politician. This series of pictures and videos which seems to become longer and more shocking every day has already affected his party, which was largely favorite for the upcoming election. The latest polls suggest his Liberal Party of Canada could now finish second, as its image of the left-wing multiculturally-oriented party was hit hard by its leader’s racist past.

A man from Moultonborough in New Hampshire had to be transported to the hospital this afternoon after his pet squirrel got stuck in his anal cavity.,"60-year Ray Frankfurt called 911 himself around 3 pm after he found himself in a pretty uncomfortable position. Janice Monroe, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. Despite Ms. Monroe’s doubts, she sent an ambulance to the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Frank Meyers, one of the paramedics who transported Mr. Frankfurt, claims the poor man was lying naked in his bathroom and a hairy red tail was protruding from his anus. Ray Frankfurt was transported to the Huggings Hospital in Wolfeboro, where doctors were able to extract the rodent. The retired mailman suffered from severe internal bleeding but was finally stabilized after a two-hour surgery. The squirrel, unfortunately, didn’t survive his misadventure. This picture of Mr. Frankfurt with his beloved Slimy was taken less than a week before the incident. Mr. Frankfurt’s problem might seem fairly unusual, but similar incidents occur a lot more frequently than most people would think. Every year, an average of 5739 Americans are hospitalized after getting foreign objects stuck in their anal cavity. Among these “foreign objects”, an average of 19 are animals, including mostly fishes, snakes and small rodents like mice or rats. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Frankfurt is the first American to get a squirrel stuck in his rear end since 2007. He has refused to comment the incident and declined all demands for an interview. Another crazy white sick sub-human with perverted sexual affliction. The White culture people are desperate to protect and uphold. Another crazy black racist with ridiculous ideas. Trying to bury his nuts ?? Animal raped him , but there is no witnesses to confirm that , torn ass is a sign of rape which this poor man had . Next time mr. Frankfurt from New Hampshire should put a oxegen mask on animals before sticken them to his pleasure hole …. God bless America & great people of newhampshire , sometimes they need to visi San Francisco ,,, RIP Slimy forever in our hearts #LLS Your email address will not be published.

 ,"Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Pickett’s father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the Confederate war general was a woman. The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as American historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document. The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was, in fact, Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister. It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was, in fact, the real ‘man’ behind the legend. Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16. The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him. “It was not uncommon at the time to fake documents or steal someone’s identity. What is truly interesting in this case, is that the former Colonel decided to send his daughter at the United States Military Academy in the place of his son and that she eventually showed to possess extraordinary military leadership” claims the Austin based historian. Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Pickett’s senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates a hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth. “This particular condition played a great part in hiding her true identity to others throughout her adult life” admits John Adams White, an American Civil War historian and expert, who was the first to point out discrepancies in George Pickett’s biography. “The discovery of the will of Colonel Robert Pickett finally explains important anachronistic elements of the man’s life” he concedes. Rio Barnhart look at the facial features. She was a woman. Men don’t have that feminine look to that degree. You can call it propaganda all you want but there are times the male takes the woman’s name not always does a woman have to take a mans name. Your email address will not be published.

A man who had his own brain replaced by a woman’s brain in September during a groundbreaking medical procedure had five car accidents in less than two weeks since he was released from the hospital.,"53-year old Phil Robertson from Scranton in Pennsylvania was miraculously saved from a brain cancer a few months ago by undergoing a successful brain transplant. He received the brain of a 37-year old woman who had died in a car accident and the operation had unforeseen consequences for the poor man. After several weeks of re-education, he was finally released from the hospital two weeks ago and returned to work. But the truck driver who had never had an accident in his life says he literally forgot how to drive. Mr. Robertson says the surgery has also totally changed his personality and his outlook on life. Dr. James Ford who performed the transplant says that minor changes in the patient’s skills or personality are normal after such a major surgery, but should gradually resorb over time. According to the doctor who treated Mr. Robertson, he should regain his lost abilities and his old personality over the next few months, but they admit that there is a small risk that some of these changes could be permanent. Dr. Ford says there is approximately a 5% chance that Mr. Robertson will be unable to “overwrite” the brain’s former knowledge, but that he normally should be able to adapt and recover over time. He estimates that this adaptation process could take between six and 18 months before he is totally back to his former self. excellent Jesus fuck, that’s enough internet for one day.

An 18-year old woman was arrested this morning after she deliberately ran over her hairdresser seven times with her car.,"According to the Chicago Police Department, Cassandra Gilmore, from Oak Lawn in Illinois, had her hair cut this morning at Luigi’s Beauty Palace in downtown Chicago, by the famous stylist Francesco Moreno. After seeing the results in a mirror, she suddenly became hysterical and tried to assault Mr. Moreno with a curling iron. Two customers of the establishment rapidly intervened to help the stylist. Fighting desperately, they were able to stop the woman and kick her out of the store. Ms. Gilmore was still determined to get her vengeance, however, and she waited more than four hours in a nearby parking lot for the victim to leave his workplace. When Mr. Moreno exited from the beauty salon around 2:15 PM, she charged him with her car and ran him over at more than 50 miles per hour. According to Roseanne Taylor, who works with Francesco Moreno and witnessed the attack, Ms. Gilmore drove back and forth over him at least 7 times. Several witnesses rapidly called the police, and the first officers arrived on the site less than two minutes later. They immediately arrested the 18-year old woman and called an ambulance on the site. Mr. Moreno was transported to the Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, where doctors were able to stabilize him. He suffers from severe internal bleeding, a perforated lung, two skull fractures, eight broken ribs and 21 other bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life. The Chicago Police Superintendent, Eddie Johnson, described the aggression as “one the most vicious” he has seen in his career. Cassandra Gilmore confessed to intentionally attacking Mr. Moreno, saying she wanted revenge after he “ruined her life” with his “botched haircut”. She allegedly explained that her prom night is only a month away and that she was under a lot of stress to make this “most important night of her life” perfect. The young woman will most likely miss her prom after all, as she now faces a total of 29 criminal charges, including attempted murder, using a vehicle as a weapon and dangerous driving.

An Albuquerque man has been banned for life from all 47 SeaWorld theme parks after he recently was caught on camera while attempting to insert his penis inside a dolphin’s blowhole.,"Bernard Seamann, 57, a retired construction worker from Albuquerque was visiting Orlando’s Discovery Cove with several friends, a theme park where guests can “talk, touch, play and swim” with bottlenose dolphins, when the assault occurred. Guests alerted security officers after Seamann, who was heavily intoxicated by alcohol, had pulled down his swimming suit and was attempting to insert his penis inside the animals’ blowhole, apparently as a joke. Buzz, a 6-year-old male dolphin, was sexually assaulted by Bernard Seamann, 57, a visitor at Orlando’s Discovery Cove, who inserted his genitals inside the animal’s blowhole. “SeaWorld has explicit guidelines and no sexual behavior of any kind is permitted nor encouraged between employees or guests with any animals inside the facility, be it of consensual or nonconsensual nature of any kind,” Discovery Cove executive manager, Peter O’Haley assured. Marine biologist and employee at Discovery Cove, Julianne White, said that the animal did not seem to have suffered any permanent injury, except a slight inflammation around the circumference of its blowhole. In 2011, a similar incident occurred when a teenager was hospitalized during a visit at Discovery Cove after the guest attempted to bait a moray eel with his genitals and had one of his testicles surgically removed as a result of the bite.

A woman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her ex-roommate for teaching her pet parrot dozens of lewd remarks which it would repeat hundreds of times every day.,"26-year old Sarah Johnson from Louisville in Kentucky claims that her former roommate, 27-year old Steven Moore, caused her psychological and emotional trauma by pushing her pet parrot to sexually harass her. According to the complaint, Mr. Moore taught the plaintiff’s bird, an orange-winged amazon parrot named Kiki, several short sentences of sexual nature, which the animal began repeating tirelessly. Ms. Johnson kicked Mr. Moore out of their apartment after only six months but says Kiki continued harassing her for almost 3 years until she was finally forced to have her it euthanized. The young woman explained her unusual situation in an interview with WHAS-TV. Sarah Johnson says Kiki knew around twelves different sentences and would repeat them several hundred times every day. She says the constant harassment caused her to isolate herself socially and even suffer from a severe depression. She eventually dropped out of college, began drinking heavily and attempted twice to commit suicide. Steven More’s lawyer, Mr. Gary White described Ms. Johson’s complaint as “ridiculous”, saying his client could not be held responsible for her bird’s behavior for years after he stopped seeing it. This unusual as raised several questions concerning human legal responsibility in their pets’ behavior and also generated a lot of reactions on social media. A few readers feel sympathy for Ms. Johnson and support her claim that her ex-roommate should be held responsible for the harassment she suffered.

"Atlanta, GA | An Atlanta woman has lost 90% of her eyesight in one of her eyes after her brother ejaculated in her face in what was meant to be a practical joke.","Eleana Thompson, 34, was apparently sleeping when her brother, James Thompson, decided to ejaculate in her left eye as a prank, not knowing he had contracted Syphilis after a recent trip to Thailand where he admits having unprotected anal sex. After a severe rash developed in her eye and the irritation became unbearable, a visit to the emergency room determined that she was infected with Syphilis, according to doctors. James Thompson told reporters he felt horrible about his sister losing her eyesight in what apparently was only meant to be a practical joke. Even if the tragic accident has left Eleana with her vision impaired, she still doesn’t blame her brother for what happened. “When I was young, he would sometimes sit on my head bare-ass and fart into my mouth or ejaculate on my homework and in my school books,” she remembers. “People often find James weird or even call him a freak, but I think they are just homophobic. He is my only brother and I will always love him,” she added. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease normally contracted from the sores of an infected person during sexual intercourse, including anal, vaginal and oral sex and unless treated timely and properly Syphilis can cause serious complications and, eventually, death. Why the hell would you let your brother do such a thing it’s discusting, no normal , to far she shouldn’t be having her brother Cum all on her face doesn’t sound right to me…. 😕 How can the sister be ok with this and think it’s normal? Pranks are pranks but this is sexual acts the brother has done to her all his life by the sound of it… cumming in school books wtf the parents should of done something about this… he should be charged or atleast give his sister the parts of his eye she needs to see again with, bloody disgusting family if they think it’s normal behavior Poor lady! What man would do this to anyone let alone his sister? 
What a low down scum this guy is! I hope his sister sues him so that he can never have a thing in life. 
I just hope the sister get’s better and regains her eyesight. WTF kind of family is this!? This is NO “simple” prank. Let alone between brother ams sister. These two have some serious issues!

When they reached it, they were surprised to find that the ship was actually a nearly 100-year old steamer identified as the  a name famously associated with the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. An exhaustive search of the ship led to the discovery of the captain’s logbook. It was, indeed, associated with the Clinchfield Navigation Company, the owners of the  , but hasn’t brought any clue concerning what happened to the ship over the last 90 years. Cuban expert, Rodolfo Salvador Cruz, believes that the captain’s logbook is authentic. This document is full of precious information concerning the life of the crew before the ship’s disappearance, but the entries stop suddenly on December 1, 1925. On 29 November 1925, the     departed Charleston, South Carolina, and headed towards Havana, Cuba. The ship had a crew of 32 men, under the command of Captain W. J. Meyer, and was carrying a cargo of 2340 tons of coal. It was reported missing two days later and was unheard of for almost 90 years. The Vice President of Council of Ministers, General Abelardo Colomé, announced that the Cuban authorities were going to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the mystery of the ship’s disappearance and reappearance. “It is very important for us to understand what happened,”  says General Colomé. The Bermuda Triangle is a loosely defined region covering the area between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda, where dozens of ships and planes have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Popular culture has attributed many of the disappearances to paranormal and supernatural phenomena, or to the activity of extraterrestrial beings. One explanation even pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of Atlantis. Despite the popularity of these strange theories, most scientists do not recognize the existence of the Bermuda Triangle and blame human mistakes and natural phenomena for the disappearances. The mysterious reappearance of the SS Cotopaxi has, however, already generated a lot of interest in the scientific community and could push some experts to change their mind on the subject. Trump is responsible It’s a very interesting subject. Needs more investigations into it.where is this ship now . so was the coal on board? That’s what I want to know too The mysterious powers behind the Renowned Bermuda Triangle will remain unresolved discovered by Man.

An elderly man from Salta in Argentina claims that he’s the infamous German dictator Adolf Hitler and that he spent the last 70 years in hiding.,"In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper  , the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg. He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that he’s actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. He says he’s decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year. The elderly man claims he’s preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image. He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September. Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isn’t really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia. Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimer’s disease. She believes her husband may possibly have been a Nazi and that he may feel guilty about his past, but she’s convinced he’s not Hitler. Mr. Gunterberg’s wife claims he’s not Adolf Hitler, only a senile old man who is beginning to lose his mind. Even if the elderly man’s claim seem rather questionable, they have sparked an animated debate in Israel and in the American Jewish community concerning the future of surviving Nazi war criminals. Mossad had proved its ambition and global reach in the past with the capture of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1960 in Argentina, but it has abandoned this mission over recent years. The Wiesenthal Center, which is still trying to find and prosecute Nazi criminals, has publicly criticized Israel in March, saying the Jewish state was ‘barely cooperating’ to its mission. More than 70 years after the end of World War 2, few states and institutions are still trying to find and prosecute the surviving Nazis and most of them will certainly die without ever being punished for their crimes.

A New Mexico man has been arrested and accused of kidnapping local neighborhood dogs and making wigs and various accessories with their fur.,"Los Lunas authorities became increasingly alarmed after dozens of pets had disappeared in the area in the past year. A local citizen also alerted the Los Lunas Police Department after discovering that Jeremiah Bishop, 79, was operating a website where he managed to sell wigs, fur handbags, and custom underwear. Bishop had already attracted attention in the area for his eccentric hairstyles, wearing different wigs every day with highly unconventional color patterns. Local neighbor Isabella Juarez says she was devastated after losing three of her dogs in the past year and learning that Bishop probably made various accessories out of their fur. Los Lunas police seized no less than 16 dog pelts but found countless accessories allegedly made from his victims’ fur. 19 wigs treated with bleach and different color dyes were also found on the location. 56 items of clothing manufactured from the fur of the dead animals were also seized by police such as pairs of socks, bras and men’s underwear. Packaged dog meat was also found in large quantities in the man’s freezer, leading officials to believe Bishop might also have eaten the meat and organs of his victims. It is not presently known how many dogs were kidnapped and slaughtered by Bishop, but local authorities estimate between 60 and 200 dogs may have fallen prey to the retired hairdresser. If found guilty and according to current animal cruelty laws in the state of New Mexico, Jeremiah Bishop, 79, could face up to three days in jail and a $500 fine.

"Garden City, UT| The remains of a large unidentified creature resembling a dinosaur, were found this morning on the western shore of Bear Lake, giving rise to many rumors concerning the legendary monster associated with the site.","The decomposed remains were found by a couple of locals who were walking on the lake’s shore. James and Christina Wilson noticed a foul smell while they were still hundreds of yards away and decided to investigate, leading to the discovery 25-foot (8 m) long carcass. The remains of the creature were partially emptied by the elements and scavengers, but still weigh more than two tons, suggesting the creature must have been enormous. A group of experts from the Utah Division of Wildlife Ressources, directed by Dr. Brian Upton, was rapidly dispatched on the site to inspect the creature. They told reporters the remains look somewhat similar to a crocodile or a mosasaur, an extinct group of large marine reptiles, but more tests and analysis are necessary to determine the true nature of the creature. Dr. Upton says the remains are very similar to a type of Aigialosaurus, a subtype of the mesosaur family of marine reptiles that lived during the Cretaceous period. The discovery of this gigantic creature in Bear Lake could finally bring an explanation to almost 150 years of alleged attacks and sightings in the region. The myth of the “Bear Lake Monster” originally grew from articles written in the 19th century by Joseph C. Rich, a Mormon colonizer in the area, purporting to report second-hand accounts of sightings of the creature. In an 1868 article in the Deseret News, he announced that   before going on to relate several sightings of the creature in recent times. The article created a stir in Salt Lake City and within a month  A 1907 letter published in a Logan, Utah newspaper claimed that two men had seen the Bear Lake behemoth attack their camp and kill one of their horses. A 4-year-old also claimed to have seen it in 1937, and a boy scout leader spoke of seeing it in 1946. In recent years the monster was mostly considered to be a tourist attraction, and the last reported sighting of the monster was in June 2002, when Bear Lake business owner, Brian Hirsch, claims to have seen the monster.

"The oldest Canadian woman alive was celebrating her 124th anniversary this morning in Mississauga, and she gave a surprising answer when asked the secret of her incredible longevity: she drinks a cup of semen every day.","Eleanor Clarice Gladstone was born in 1895 in Hamilton, in Ontario. She was married and widowed twice, had seven children, 28 grandchildren and dozens of great-grandchildren. More than 250 people gathered yesterday to celebrate her birthday, including her family as well as several media representatives. When asked by reporters if she had any secrets to remain healthy and alert at her age, the elderly woman gave an answer that provoked uncontrollable laughter from the guests. Ms. Gladstone says she had to hide her health secret when she was younger because of society’s social conservatism at the beginning of the 20th century and says she hopes others can now benefit from her discovery. Ms. Gladstone says she has been collecting sperm from residents at her senior’s residence since the death of her husband to be able to get her daily cup. Experts consulted on the subject confirmed that semen has several beneficial effects that help overall longevity. Notably, due to the endorphins, estrone, prolactin, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and serotonin contained in it, semen has incredible natural antidepressant properties. It also has several benefits including stress-relieving and anxiety-reducing properties as well as sleep regulate hormones, but one specific element in semen could explain Ms. Gladstone’s incredible longevity: Spermidine. When ingested, this unique element has been proven to dramatically increase the lifespan of animals by as much as 25 percent and was also found to prevent liver disease as well as liver cancer.   That’s a whole lot of man gravy granny!

Lexington | A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ.,"According to the  Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ.  wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.   whatever makes you happy man…

A man was arrested last night in Lower Manhattan after an apparent sleepwalking incident led him to sodomize a police horse.,"Around 3:00 AM this morning, a pair of NYPD mounted officers left their horses in front of a Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant before going inside for a coffee. A few minutes later, they heard the animals neighing and being agitated, to they rushed outside to find 39-year-old Hector Gomez actively sodomizing one of the horses. The man showed totally non-cooperative with the officers and was finally tased 13 times before he could be neutralized and arrested. During his interrogation, it was revealed that Mr.Gomez suffers from parasomnia and somnambulism and that he had absolutely no memory of the incident since he was sleeping at the time. According to NYPD spokesman, John Fitzgerald, despite being accused of a horrendous crime, the accused drew sympathy from his interrogators and looked more like a victim than an aggressor. Mr. Fitgerald says the NYPD has no choice but to file charges, but that he hopes Mr. Gomez “receives help rather than punishment”. Mr. Gomez’s victim, a 6-year old Stallion named Bucky, suffered no serious physical harm from the assault but showed obvious symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome, according to the NYPD. Sleepwalking has been successfully used in the past as a legal defense in several cases involving a wide variety of crimes. In 2013, a 78-year old Indiana woman was found not guilty by reason of insanity after throwing 17 of her cats out of the window of her 8th-floor apartment while sleepwalking. In 2016, a naked man who assaulted 17 people with a toilet plunger in Chicago was also found not guilty by reason of insanity. In all cases, accusees recognized they had committed the act but were not considered responsible for their actions as they were unconscious at the time of the crimes. Mr. Gomez faces charges of assaulting a police officer, bestiality and indecent exposure. His trial is scheduled to begin in December when he will face a maximum of 65 years of imprisonment.

"A woman was arrested this morning on the Atlantic island of Saint Helena for accidentally causing the death of the oldest known animal in the world, a 185-year old tortoise named Jonathan.","The famous Seychelles giant tortoise lived on the grounds of Plantation House, the official residence of the island’s Governor, and belonged to the government of Saint Helena since 1882. According to the Saint Helena Police Service, 47-year old Margaret Sanders was visiting Plantation House with her family when her legs began to hurt and she needed to rest. The 520-lbs woman began looking for a place to sit down, and unfortunately confused the venerable animal with a decorative bench and decided to sit on it. Ms. Sanders’ weight was too important for the tortoise’s carapace and it immediately began cracking up, crushing the animal underneath. The site’s veterinarian, Dr. Frank Hollins, arrived less than a minute later, but Jonathan had already died of suffocation. Dr. Hollins was visibly emotional when he described the scene in an interview with the BBC, only hours after the incident. The veterinarian describes Jonathan’s death as a great loss for Saint Helena and the entire world. Dr. Hollins spent the last 32 years of his life caring for Jonathan and other tortoises on the Plantation House property. He described the 185-year old tortoise’s death as a great loss for the world. Jonathan was famous around the world as the oldest known land animal and had already appeared in several media over his very long life. The elderly tortoise was both a member of an endangered species, a major tourist attraction and a government property, so Margaret Sanders was immediately arrested and detained by the island’s police. She could face a variety of criminal charges, including the reckless destruction of government property, animal cruelty and even poaching. The Saint Helena Police Service has confirmed that multiple accusations should be filed over the next few days, once investigators have met with all witnesses of the incident.

"Miami, FL | The famous golf star Tiger Woods has taken another hit this morning as a state court ordered him to undergo a total of 137 paternity tests.","The court’s decision comes after request formulated by 121 women who claim to have been Wood’s mistresses and to have given birth to his children. Many of the women yelled and cried with joy when the judge announced his verdict, as some of them had been fighting for more than seven years to obtain this judgment. One of the women who claim to have had children with the golfer, Molly Sanders, was interviewed by WFNC-TV only minutes after the court announced its decision. The court has given Mr. Woods 30 days to undergo a DNA test or face imprisonment and severe fines. Tiger Woods’ lawyer confirmed that their client would comply with the court’s decision and take all necessary tests. Molly Sanders attended court with her 8-year old son Tommy and says she can’t wait for her boy to finally meet his father. Tiger Woods contributed to the popularity of golf in the 1990s and was the dominant force in golf in the 2000s. Woods first took leave from professional golf in December 2009 in order to focus on his personal life, after his many alleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through many worldwide media sources, leading to his divorce from Elin Nordegren. Since then, he has been having difficulties on the courses while attracting a lot of attention for his personal problems. In the days and months following Woods’ admission of infidelity, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. Earlier this year, the golfer was also implicated in an incident involving drugs and alcohol. On May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office at about 3:00 am EDT for driving under the influence of five different types of drugs. This new judgment against him will certainly add more pressure on Wood’s shoulders, which means his performances on the golf courses aren’t bound to improve very soon. They just Jealous cause he Won The Master’s Again! Tiger leave those Ugly Bitches Alone, and Wrap It Up! With these many potential offsprings, his kids are going to accidentally court each other and be forced to move to Alabama when it’s too late. That’s a lot of hole in ones!

"Burbank, CA | A 56-year-old woman has presented a paternity action lawsuit this morning before the California state court, alleging that she is the biological daughter of Marilyn Monroe and former President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.","Gladys Baker Morris spent most of her life believing that Marilyn Monroe’s cousin, Meredith Baker, was her biological mother. In March 2014, while on her deathbed, her “mother” told her that she had actually been adopted and that her biological parents were incredibly famous. After hearing her mother’s confession, Ms. Morris underwent a lot of research to clarify her origins and rapidly found out that she had indeed been adopted. In took a total of 18 months of legal proceedings, however, before she was finally able to obtain her adoption record, including her birth certificate. This amazing document, which has become the cornerstone of her legal claim, clearly states that she is the daughter of Norma Jeane Mortenson, better known as Marilyn Monroe, and of the assassinated U.S. President, Jonh F. Kennedy. Marilyn Monroe and President John Fitzgerald Kennedy are known to have had an affair in 1961-62, and Ms. Morris claims she was born from that extramarital relationship. More than 50 years after her death, stories concerning Marilyn Monroe’s love life or alleged pregnancies continue to regularly make the headlines. Two ill-fated pregnancies in 1957 and 1959 are known to have led the actress to have surgery to correct an ectopic pregnancy. Some persistent rumors, originating from her gynecologist, Dr. Leon Krohn, have suggested that Marilyn Monroe had become pregnant again in 1961, and given birth to a baby girl in June 1962. There has always been very little evidence to back these allegations, however,  and many people hope that the court procedures launched by Ms. Morris will finally bring an end to more than 50 years of speculation, concerning the existence and identity of this mysterious child. In 2008, a Californian woman named Nancy Maniscalco Miracle made the headlines by claiming to be the lost daughter of Marilyn Monroe, while releasing a controversial biography of the star. Her claims were rapidly dismissed and proven to be a publicity stunt, when the DNA test confirmed that she had no filiation with the star, whatsoever. Gladys Baker Morris must now wait for the results of the DNA tests before she can launch any lawsuits to claim any eventual heirloom. If her claims turn out to be true, she could the only natural heir to the estate of Marilyn Monroe, which is estimated to be worth more than $100 million and still makes more than $5M each year. Indeed, she confirms that she intends to sue the Marilyn Monroe Foundation over rights and royalties, once the DNA test confirms her identity. She also hopes to be able to meet and possibly develop a relationship with her estranged half-sister, United States ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy. If I look form the side, I can see Rosie Odonnell & Bill Cosbie, or if I squint my eyes I’d say Jocelyn Wildenstein and Pee Wee Herman – yeh that’s it, it’s definitely Pee Wee and Joce. She has a striking resemblance. Indeed she is a look alike. If she is MM and JFK’s child, I can’t wait to see the faces on the Kennedy clan when she sues for a portion of their money too! Shut the fuck up lol That’s actually Susan Griffiths.

,"In an exclusive interview with CNTV-4, Ivana Trumps claimed the American President is obsessed with the size of his genitals, and has already tested “every product on the market” in order to increase the size of his penis. According to the former model and socialite, he even overdosed twice, in 1989 and 1991, after ingesting more than 300 penis enlargement pills in a day. She says the president still takes penis enlargement drugs, but has reduced and stabilized his consumption to approximately 45 to 60 pills a day. According to his ex-wife, Trump’s reddish skin color is a sign of high blood pressure, caused by his consumption of penis enlargement drugs. Donald Trump married his first wife Ivana in 1977, and they had three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. She played an important role in her husband’s business until their high-profile divorce in 1991. During the procedure, she accused the real-estate tycoon of ‘rape,’ although she later clarified: not in the ‘criminal sense.’ Despite a troublesome separation, Donald and Ivana Trump have remained close, and she even attended his inauguration as President. Only days after her ex-husband won the elections, she told the New York Post: “I will suggest that I be ambassador for the Czech Republic.” Some experts believe that by revealing shocking information to the media about the President, Ms Trump is attempting to put pressure on him in order to reach her objective. he needs to be castrated all is needed is a tweezer and a nail clipper, he is a rapist and an all around scumbag I wonder if it’s hereditary and eric & jr have the same issue?

The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital, where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable, while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises.

Dr. Frank Olson, who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital, says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them.

An American citizen was arrested under the Saudi counterterrorism law this morning in Riyadh and accused of “defaming the reputation of the state or the king” after refusing an offer from a Saudi prince to trade his wife for a herd of 45 camels.,"59-year old Karim Najibullah, a Ford Motor Company executive from Dearborn in Michigan, and his 27-year old Saudi wife Aliyah, spent the last two weeks visiting her family in the city of Abha, located in the south-western part of the kingdom. On Wednesday, the couple was invited to a wedding reception where several members of the royal family were also present, including Prince Khalid bin Abdullah Al Saud, a famous horse and camel breeder with a herd including some rare specimens worths over 2 million riyals ($533,300) each. During the reception, Prince Khalid attempted to negotiate the purchase of Mr. Najibullah’s wife by offering several of his prized animals, but the American repeatedly declined the prince’s offers. When the couple attempted to take their plane back to U.S. this morning, they were arrested by the Saudi police. Mr. Najibullah was taken into police custody, while the whereabouts of his wife remain unknown. The Minister of Justice and President of Supreme Judicial Council, Sheikh Walid bin Mohammed Al-Samaani, justified the arrest and called for an exemplary sentence against Mr. Najibullah. Refusing any demand from a member of the royal family is a serious crime for Saudi citizens, but only 7 Americans have ever been sentenced for such crimes.

Mr. Najibullah faces some extremely serious accusations and could be sentenced to harsh corporal punishment, including public lashings, lengthy jail terms, and even death.

"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.","Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the  According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA. The terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden was supposedly killed by United States Navy SEALs on May 2, 2011, is still alive in a luxurious Nassau suburb. Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas. Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September. A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a patriot, and a traitor, for his revelations of thousands of classified documents. Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.

"Manchester, NY | A team of archaeologists excavating a drumlin known as  Mormon hill or the Cumorah, in western New York, have discovered a set of gold plates which they believe could be linked to the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith Jr.","The scientists, led by Professor Abraham Jones, are associated with the Brigham Young University’s faculty of archaeology. They were using advanced metal detectors, lasers and other ground-penetrating imaging technology to look for underground structures when they noticed a small cave-like cavity. They dug up the entrance, which was buried under a dozen feet of rocks and dirt, and explored the very exiguous cavern. The walls and ceiling were covered with ancient traces of soot, presumably from torches, suggesting the cave had been visited many times in the past. On top of a large flat stone resembling an altar, they found what looks like a book made of metal plates. The scientists explored the mysterious cavern, but have not been able to recover any other artifact. They have found, however, a few signs of human activity like the ashes of two ancient campfires. The “book” is made of a set of twelve metal plates, each measuring six inches (15 cm) in width, eight inches (20 cm) in length approximately half an inch (1.27 centimeter) in thickness. The plates are made of a copper-gold alloy and are held together by three D-shaped rings, forming a sort of book.  The entire volume measures a total of nearly six inches [15 cm] in thickness and weights 59 pounds (26.76 kg). The plates are covered with mysterious symbols, very similar to the  “reformed Egyptian” characters, written by Joseph Smith Jr. on the document known as the “Anthon Transcript”. Many of the symbols on the plates found by the archaeologists are identical to those drawn by the prophet, in 1928. LDS scholars have hypothesized that the reformed Egyptian writing could have developed from other modified Egyptian scripts such as  , a priestly shorthand for hieroglyphics. Joseph Smith Jr. is said to have found similar golden plates on September 22, 1823, in a hill near his home in Manchester, New York. He claimed that an angel named Moroni had directed him to a buried stone box, containing a set of gold plates, covered with strange symbols. Smith translated the text of the Book of Mormon over the next several years by using a seer stone, which he placed in the bottom of a hat and then placed the hat over his face to view the words written within the stone. He finally published the book in 1830, which was meant to be a complement to the Bible. This new discovery could be the most important material and historical proof ever found, to back the claims of Joseph Smith Jr. Professor Jones and the scientists from Brigham Young University will now perform an extensive series of tests and analysis to determine if the plates could indeed be linked to the prophet. The tablets were the veil that Moses made to imbelish God,Moses had a previous life as Able, he knew Egypt worshipped the performing arts to act out giblys of records living words. Don’t be so nieve, this religion brain-washed my son, he had to be such a nice young man, does this religious cult, teach their followers to hate the non mormons??? I’ve lost my son to this cult!!!

,"41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado. The powerful winds reaching more than 220 miles per hour, carried and shook the mobile home for 4 hours and 18 minutes, sometimes at altitude of more than 1000 feet. After carrying the house across Northern Colorado and Southern Kansas, the tornado finally dropped it on a car, just outside of Wichita, 129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin. A few locals have witnessed the landing, like Michael Johnson, a 63-year old neighboring farmer,  who describes an incredibly spectacular scene. The 60-feet long mobile home landed on an unoccupied car, in Butler county. The building has suffered surprisingly little structural damage considering the distance over which it was transported. Despite the violence of the crash, with the house landing at a speed of more than 90 miles per hour, the incident did not cause any death or serious injury. All five occupants of the house have miraculously survived their incredible misadventure, suffering only a few scratches and bruises. The family believes that their prayers were answered and that their survival is due to a divine intervention. An isolated set of concrete stairs remains on the family’s property in the Rolling Hills Mobile Home Park, in Tulsa, marking the site of the house’s former location. This is not the first time that a house is lifted off the ground by a tornado and carried over some distance with its occupant inside, without them being killed. It is, however, the longest distance ever recorded for such a case, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. On the evening of Thursday 12 June 2014, a house in Burnet County, Texas, about 16 km to the northeast of the city of Bertram, was lifted off its foundations by a tornado, The house was carried safely to a nearby pasture, with four members of the Ashworth family, plus their two dogs, unharmed.

An independent investigation was ordered to determine the cause of these mysterious deaths, and the experts have made their conclusions public yesterday. According to the 26-page report,  the penguins suffered from severe depression, caused by their “inhumane living conditions”. The marine biologists and veterinarian pathologists concluded that the penguins had chosen to commit suicide “in order to put an end to their pain and suffering”. The corporate curator for Zoological Operations at all SeaWorld Parks, Chuck Tompkins, met reporters this morning to react to report, which he called a “deceitful and biased piece of shit”. said Mr Tompkins. Seaworld’s corporate curator, Chuck Tompkins, dismissed the report as fallacious, insisting that birds were unable of being suicidal. This new incident occurs at a really bad moment for Seaworld, which is already struggling to maintain a positive public image. The corporation has been in the crosshairs of animal rights activists and has experienced a drop in revenue since the release of the documentary  in 2013. The movie chronicled the case of Tilikum, a killer whale that caused the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, in 2010. Three of Seaworld’s famous orcas have also died over the last six months, and all of them were still very young, considering their 100-year life expectancy. The last to date is 18-year-old Unna, who died from a rare fungal infection last week, causing reactions from many animal rights organizations. amazing A low security prison is still a prison.

"Springfield, MA| A man from Massachusetts is suing Golden Corral Corporation for 2 million dollars for false advertising after being literally thrown out of one of the chain’s restaurants by the employees last Thursday.","According to witnesses, the 51-year-old man who lives on welfare was expelled from the restaurant after he then spent more than 7 hours on-site, ingesting a quantity of food which has been estimated between 50 and 70 pounds. Despite the fact that the restaurant advertised the buffet as “all-you-can-eat”, the manager of the establishment seems to have lost patience at some point, telling him that his meal would be free but asking him to leave. The manager’s intervention angered Mr. Fleming, and a brief altercation took place before he was finally pushed out of the restaurant. He immediately called the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant, and he intends to make the people responsible for his mistreatment, pay for their actions. “It’s a serious injustice, and I am deeply insulted!” Mr. Flemmings told reporters. Mr. Flemming says the employee of the Golden Corral did not use any insulting language, but he claims that the disgust that was visible on their faces has left him with some deep emotional wounds. The direction of the restaurant chain quickly issued a press release announcing that the decision to expel Mr. Flemmings was a regrettable personal initiative from an overzealous franchise manager. They also said that some financial indemnities had been offered to compensate the damage suffered by the victim, but had been refused. Mr. Flemmings confirmed that he had been offered a significant amount of money by the company, but he is convinced that he can get more if he goes to court. The primary hearing, in this case, should take place on March 7, at the Springfield District Court. All you can eat, not eat all the food you see. He should have taken what they offered.

"Scottsdale, AZ | A rave party turned terribly wrong for a young Arizona man highly intoxicated on ecstasy after he ended up having sexual intercourse with an electric fence and sustaining third-degree burns on his lower abdomen and genitals.","Adam Weinberg, 26, was rescued by fellow partygoers of the illegally set up rave after they noticed he was in horrible agony and unable to unclamp himself from the electrified fence surrounding the area. The young man who was highly intoxicated on several drugs including ecstasy apparently mistook the electric fence for a sexual partner before feeling the burst of 220 volts and 13 amps passing through his body. “I was high as fuck. I’d taken some GHB and some DMT to start out the party. I then did a shit load of Ecstasy and a bunch of amphetamines before taking a few hits of cocaine. Then someone poured some acid drops into my eyes and I totally lost it,” he told reporters. “At first, the electricity passing through me was like the biggest orgasm I have ever had. I felt like my balls were going to explode, that’s when I felt the horrible burning sensation and the smell of burning flesh,” he remembers before passing out. Although he has sustained second-degree and third-degree burns to his lower abdomen and genitals, as well as having one of his testicles removed, Dr. Hellen Murdoch of HonorHealth Medical Center says that with reconstructive surgery he should recover swiftly. Adam Weinberg says he hopes his story will reach other young adults and prevent further injuries or even deaths. “I realize now that I am a drug addict and that I could’ve died in the most stupid way ever,” he told the Scottsdale Herald. “But if my testimony can help just one person not to do the same thing I did, it will be worth the shame and ridicule this news coverage will bring upon me,” he concluded.

A renowned veterinarian from Trenton in Missouri was arrested this morning after being filmed by a security camera while having sex with several dogs.,"According to the Trenton Police Department, an investigation was launched on Dr. James Thompson in January after several dog owners filed complaints about their dogs suffering from anal bleeding after visiting his clinic. During the investigation, the police convinced the owners of the West Trenton Animal Hospital where Dr. Thompson practiced to install several new security cameras around the building. The police and the owners were completely shocked when they saw the video footage a few weeks later. Over a period of two weeks, Dr. Thompson was filmed sexually aggressing 19 different dogs, mostly smaller breeds like miniature poodles, bichons, and chihuahuas. TPD spokesman Lt. Frank Simmons says the aggressions were rather violent and must have been traumatizing for the animals. According to Lt. Simmons, the veterinarian could have made a great number of victims. A total of 352 criminal charges have been filed against him, and the TPD says this number will probably double over the next few days. Trenton Police Chief, Captain Tommy Wright, says the investigation was far from complete but the investigators decided to arrest Dr. Thompson before he assaulted other animals. According to him, the number of victims could be over 5000. Dr. Thompson’s was released on bail a few hours after his arrest and immediately met reporters to claim his innocence.

,"The Garda Síochána (Irish police) was called on the site early this morning, after some neighbors complained about the smell emanating from his room. They found the body of 31-year old, James Francis Alexander, a young British nobleman mostly known for his claim to be a member of the Royal British family. According to the spokesman of the Irish police, Lt. Seamus O’connor, the young man had multiple bullet wounds, and the police found some signs of struggle in his room, suggesting that he was victim of a violent crime. Lt. O’connor told reporters. James Francis Alexander, the son of a British Lord from Lincolnshire, claimed he was in fact Prince Harry, and had been exchanged when he was 8-years old for threatening to reveal that he was not the son of Prince Charles. Mr Alexander had attracted a lot of attention from the British public and media in 2014, when he published his book entitled “ “. In this book, he claimed to be the real son of Princess Diana, saying that he was replaced by a look-alike at Queen Elizabeth’s demand when he was 8-years old, after he threatened to reveal that Prince Charles was not his biological father. He says that he was awoken at night by his father’s butler and driven to Lincolnshire, where he was exchanged with the son of Lord Edward James Alexander, who had his age and also the particularity of looking a lot like him. His claims had received some intense coverage for a while from the British tabloids, but then had suddenly disappeared from the media after a few days, generating rumors of cover-up among conspiracy theorists. Indeed, despite the fact that the first 50 000 copies of his book had sold in less then a week, his publisher had surprisingly decided not to have more copies printed and it rapidly disappeared from bookstores. The young author had then accused the Royal family of pressuring his publisher and his editor, in order to have his book taken off the shelves. An encounter between Mr Alexander and Prince Charles at the 2014 London Book Fair had resulted in a rather digraceful scene, as the heir to the British throne called the young man “a little bastard”, before telling him to “leave his family alone”. Mr Alexander fled England in January 2015 and sought asylum in Ireland, saying that he was being followed and harassed by the MI5 and that he had received multiple death threats by extremist supporters of the British monarchy. Some sources close to the young man, told   that he had recently had contacts with the British embassy concerning an eventual return to England, and that he even had dinner with an attaché of the embassy at the end of the month of March, probably less than 24 hours before he was killed. Despite these shocking coincidences, the police refuses for the moment, to link the British embassy or secret services to Mr Alexander’s death, saying that they are “following every possible lead” that could help them solve the case.

A San Diego homeless man was hospitalized and later arrested for indecent exposure and lewd act after he was seen in public having sex with a manhole cover.,"The incident occurred on University Avenue around twelve in the afternoon when nearby high school students on lunch break alerted local police. San Diego Police and paramedics were forced to separate the man’s genitals from the manhole cover which resulted in hospitalization after it was revealed he had suffered from a severe penile fracture. Steven Wood, 43, claims he was drunk and passed out when he later woke up and found that his genitals were stuck inside the gap of a manhole cover and, unable to free himself, asked passersby for help in vain. Although Steven Wood, 43, claims he was possibly the victim of a prank, San Diego Police spokesman John Smirk told reporters it is highly improbable that someone other than himself inserted his genitals inside the gap in the manhole cover. Paramedics were called on the scene when police officers were unable to lift the man from the ground, who was stuck to the manhole cover and visibly in agonizing pain. At one moment, officers and paramedics acknowledged hearing a loud snapping sound, which doctors later confirmed to be caused by a severe penile fracture. Steven Wood, 43, is well known by the San Diego Police for several similar infractions on numerous occasions and was last arrested in November, only days following Halloween. A local citizen alerted authorities at the time, alleging that Wood was committing sexual acts on a pumpkin stolen off private property in the area and in plain daylight.

Once he came out of the washroom, the lights were out and the staff was gone.

In the hours before he was discovered by staff clocking on for their early morning shift, he managed to work his way through thousands of dollars worth of food. This morning, the aisles of the supermarket were so full of empty food packages and other trash that it looked like it had been hit by a tornado. According to the store manager, he also drank a total 17 cans of cola, 2 gallons of orange juice, 5 cans of energy drink and one and a half gallon of maple syrup, a ridiculous quantity of liquid for a man who was locked up only in eight hours. Mr. Norris admits that he ingested large amounts of food, but claims it was only due to nervosity. Despite Mr. Norris’ explanations, many people are questioning his version of the events and suggest he might have planned the incident. A spokesman for the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that an investigation had been launched in order to determine if Mr. Norris was indeed, a victim of the supermarket employees’ negligence, or if he intentionally hid inside the store. Fayette County assistant Sheriff, Mark Taylor, confirmed to reporters that an investigation was underway to determine if criminal accusations could be filed against Mr. Norris.

Bukowski first believed his cattle were being harassed by coyotes until he discovered it was, in fact, a man that was the source of all the disturbance. “He asked me not to shoot. He told me he wouldn’t do it again if I didn’t call the police” Bukowski, 67, told reporters. “I don’t know what those Hindus preach at church, but that sure sounds to me like the church of the Devil,” he added, laughing. Ted Bukowski, 67, believed his cattle were being harassed by coyotes until he discovered Chowdhury, 34, sexually molesting one of his cows. Professor of Religious studies at the University of Houston, Janet Fitzgerald, believes Rajiv Chowdhury’s sexual assault upon the cow must be understood in the specific cultural and religious context of Hinduism. “The man lost his wife last year and possibly was honest when he said he believed the animal was the reincarnation of his dead wife,” she told local reporters. “In Hinduism, sex with animals is not an uncommon theme and many of their deities share half-human, half-animal features,” she explained. Bestiality is currently illegal in the state of Texas since 2017 and offenders face a maximum penalty of a one year in prison and/or a fine of not more than $4,000, according to legal experts.

Show me where in Islam sex with animals is permitted 
You can’t because the punishment for sex with animals in Islam is 1000 lashes Yes there is life after death if your Christian religion as when we die we will go to heaven to be with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Actually this is jus a wack job reincarnation doesn’t work that way to the extent why in Hinduism there is a cast system the highly educated Brahmcariyas and the uhum untouchebles who only do prayers but do not understand the context of reincarnation. The fact reincarnation is not another life nor is it an after life it’s actually means when we die our atoms and electrons will still exist but not born again into another humanbeing or animal these ppl in short don’t understand the vedas nor understand the ancient dic scriptures it is no where stated we have an after life actually nirvana means extinction or the end in short there is no pife after death.

"Malibu, CA | A California yoga teacher who performed a fellatio on himself was rushed into the Malibu Urgent Care Center this week after doctors had to surgically remove his own penis from his throat.","Marvin Lewinski, 39, who was practicing a Tibetan form of Tantric yoga at the time of the incident, managed to contact 9-1-1 before eventually losing consciousness moments later. Lewinski, a Malibu yoga instructor who specializes in teaching Karmamudrā, a Vajrayana Buddhist technique of sexual practice with a physical or visualized consort, said he should have been more prudent in his practice. Dr. Peter Irving at the Malibu Urgent Care Center said that his patient would have suffered brain damage or organ failure if the procedure hadn’t been carried out in time. Although Tantric sex is usually practiced with a partner, Lewinski claims his superior techniques involve “highly evolved spiritual beings” with whom “sex becomes an expression of divine union” and a “conduit for consciousness.” Marvin Lewinski, who currently has no medical insurance, is set to launch a GoFundMe campaign this week where he will offer free online yoga classes to help him reimburse his medical fees that amount up to $236,000. $236,000? You could have bought a life time supply of prostitutes , buddy. Next time hire a professional! Monica Blewinsky Did anyone else catch the last name? Lewinski will always be associated with penises. i did NOT have sexual relations with myself! Lmao stop it Yoga from budha

"A set of 54-year-old conjoined twins from Michigan are facing each other in court, as one of the siblings is contesting his brother’s right to engage in sexual acts without his consent.","Alfred and Wilbert Peterson were born joined at the waist and facing each other, and spent their entire life this way. They have two sets of arms and legs and their own hearts and stomachs but share a lower digestive tract and a penis. This shared penis has become a major source of conflict between the twins over recent years, and Alfred is now going to court to keep his brother from masturbating. Alfred says he is suffering from insomnia and from a post-traumatic syndrome after waking up at night on three occasions to catch his brother masturbating. As for Wilbert, he claims he has done nothing wrong and insists that he has the legal right to masturbate. He said he waited for his brother to be asleep because he knew he was against it didn’t want to disturb or shock him. Wilbert’s lawyer, Michael Gallagher, says this trial threatens not only his client’s basic human rights, but also “the sexuality of all conjoined twins”. The two of them were facing each other in a specially adapted courtroom this morning in Flint, Michigan. Dozens of reporters were present to cover this unusual case, which should clarify many legal issues concerning the sexuality of conjoined twins. At the moment, the Michigan state law doesn’t include any guidelines for individuals sharing the same genital organs. Across the U.S., the only state to have a law concerning the sexuality of conjoined twins is California, which passed a bill in 2011. Dear death asterpid…now is the time.

"San Mateo, CA | A Californian man is being treated at the San Mateo Medical Center after his boyfriend’s fist was stuck for a painstaking 14 hours in his own rectum.","The couple who were allegedly practicing “fisting,” a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the partner’s rectum, called 9-1-1 after they were unable to release the man’s hand from his boyfriend’s anal cavity. Both men were transported by ambulance to San Mateo Medical Center where hospital staff successfully released the man’s hand only 14 hours later, a complicated task due to heavy inflammation, blood loss and risk of laceration, say doctors. “I just talked to my mom on the phone and she told me she had felt the same thing when she was in labor,” he admitted. “My mom was really supportive through this whole ordeal. She talked to me on the phone the whole time the doctors were trying to get Hernando’s hand out of there. She’s just the greatest,” he added in tears. Mathew Cunning’s boyfriend, Hernando Iglesias, says his big hands and the fact they did not use any lubricant are to blame for the incident. The couple firmly believes that, had they used lubricant, the trip to the hospital could have been avoided. “I usually use Crisco or vegetable oil but we were out of everything. It was definitely not our lucky day” admits Iglesias, visibly amused by the media attention. “Matt is a real hero, he handled the pain like a real soldier. The hospital staff was awesome. They found me a bed so I could sleep a few hours through the procedure,” he added. Matthew Cunning, who has lost a large amount of blood and received an impressive 37 stitches, is set to be released from the hospital in the next few days and should not endure any permanent damage from the incident, say doctors. Although Cunning admits his “handballing” days aren’t necessarily over, he hopes others in the “fisting community” will pay heed to this incident and use the proper lubricants to safely enjoy the practice.

"The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Monsanto, Hugh Grant, received a performance bonus of more than $600 millions for the 2017 fiscal years, announced the multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation this morning.","After being questioned on the subject by investors on Wednesday during Monsanto Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, the company Board of directors released the information this morning, announcing that it had granted Mr. Grant $603.45 million in an annual bonus, including $574 million in restricted stock units. Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Pierre Courduroux, justified the bonus by saying that despite the fact that the year was a bit disappointing in terms of sales and profits, the company had built some “very solid and concrete bases” for many future projects. According to Mr. Courduroux, the false accusations made by some South American doctors, which had linked one of their products with the numerous cases of birth defects, are largely responsible for the fall in the company’s profits. Monsanto announced on Wednesday, that its profit had fallen by 25% in the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago. According to most experts, the company has suffered as farmers cut back on spending, squeezed by plummeting commodity prices. Its bottom line has also been pressured by the strong dollar and price cuts on products, spurred by competitors. Despite these setbacks, the leaderboard of the corporation, which has a long history of working with agricultural producers to boost yields and come up with valuable innovations, seems confident to be able to bounce back over the next few months. “Well Deserved”? wtf he should be punished for crime against humanity He should not be given a penny with a salary of $19.5 M but it’s how the globalist reward their peons for committing murder around the globe.

A man suffering from dwarfism almost died after falling inside a U.S. postal mailbox last Friday and remaining stuck inside the narrow container for more than two days.,"49-year old Walter Morrison, from Fayetteville in North Carolina, was found on Monday morning by a postal employee collecting the mail. The 3’10” tall man was unconscious and severely dehydrated, so he was rapidly transported to the nearby Cape Fear Valley Medical Center where he was admitted in a critical condition. Thomas Dunsmore, the mailman who found Mr. Morrison, described the scene in an interview with MSNBC. He had just finished extracting the poor man from the narrow container when the paramedics arrived a few minutes later. Tom Dunmore,  who saved Mr. Morrison’s life, told MSNBC that he’d found many strange things in mailboxes over his 30-year career, but this was “by far the most disturbing”. Fortunately, the medical staff was able to stabilize Mr. Morrison after a few hours of intensive care, and he regained consciousness the next morning. According to doctors, he broke his left thumb and his right foot, but should suffer no long-term physical consequences from his misadventure. Mr. Morrison says he fell in in the box on Friday morning while attempting to mail a letter and was unable to get out. He claims the accident was in part due to the fact that the mailbox was almost 40 years old and wasn’t as safe as the new ones. In fact, some employees of the U.S. postal services replaced it only hours later be a new one, suggesting this claim may be at least partially true. Walter Morrison says he’s considering filing a lawsuit against the U.S.P.S. but first wants to take time to recover from his ordeal. Maybe somebody tried to mail him Big McThankies from McSpankies What a dick! I reckon he was after a compo claim.

Jarod Burns and his son were patrolling their property with rifles in hand, looking for signs of bears that may have awakened early from their hibernation, when he saw the hairy creatures. Mr. Burns and his son were convinced they were facing a couple of sasquatches, folkloric creatures said to be hairy, upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the North American wilderness. The two men fired eight shots, hitting Mr. Mumford three times in the shoulder, the leg, and the abdomen, and hitting Ms. Smith twice in the thigh and the forearm. Fortunately, the couple started screaming and swearing after getting shot, helping the hunters realize their mistake and call 911. Jarod Burns and his son fired eight shots in the couple’s direction, believing they were a couple of mating sasquatches. The adventurous couple was transported to Barnsville hospital where doctors were able to stabilize their condition and no longer fear for their lives. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office has opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances of the incident, and criminal charges could eventually be filed against the negligent hunters.

Linda Hovensky was beaten, tased and thrown on the sidewalk with her pants down in front a large crowd after being mistaken for a transgender woman The woman represented a visible threat to police officers on the scene, explains Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department spokesman, Allan Jones. “The woman threatened police officers and that is what made things difficult for her and the agents that intervened” said Jones, during the press conference. “She was hysterical and represented a possible threat to our officers who followed all proper procedures in this case,” he adds. Miss Hovensky was jailed for a period of over five hours at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department because she was unable to identify herself before a friend was able to bring proof of her identity to police headquarters. Gov. Pat McCrory signed the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, also known as House Bill 2 or HB2 in 2016.

After their meeting with Ms. Sullivan, the representatives of Guinness opened a second investigation concerning the record for the number of child support pensions received by one person. The Detroit native is already the beneficiary of pensions paid by 11 different men and is implicated in two other custody cases which should proceed before the family court over the next two months.

An Ohio woman has pressed sexual assault charges against her dentist after she woke up from a root canal treatment to find out she had a toothbrush placed inside her vagina.,"Annabelle Carlin, 38, claims she was to undergo a root canal treatment when dentist Giórgos Mitsotákis, 56, injected her a light sedative. Carlin believes she was unconscious for over half an hour before she woke up to find she had a toothbrush in her vagina. Giórgos Mitsotákis’s lawyer, Konstantínos Koutsoúmbas, says the whole incident is a terrible misunderstanding and that the toothbrush must have slipped from his client’s hands and into his patient’s genitals. To make things worse, Carlin also realized on the way home that the dentist had inserted other objects inside her genitals. “On the ride back home, I realized that he had squirted toothpaste inside me and in the shower, I realized I had like a twelve-foot-long string of dental floss inside my anus” she added, in horror. Giórgos Mitsotákis, 56, is presently under Springfield police custody and could face multiple sexual assault charges as police say there may be more victims and are urging anyone with information to come forward. In 2017, one of Mitsotákis’s patients also claimed that he had found pubic hairs in his mouth after undergoing general anesthesia as well but charges were eventually dropped after an out-of-court settlement was reached by both parties.

In his allocution presented this morning in front of the Adair County Circuit Court, the teenage boy claims he was an undesired child and that his parents deliberately gave him that first name to make him “a designated scapegoat”. He claims his parent’s ill-intentioned plan has worked, and that he has to endure constant mockeries and bullying because of his name. The young man has even been physically assaulted on several occasions and has even been hospitalized twice. He says he’s tried to get a name change in the past and asked his parents for their permission on several occasions, but they declined every time. He finally decided to file a lawsuit against his parents in order to obtain a financial compensation for the suffering that they deliberately caused him. His parents vehemently deny his allegations and claim that they simply named him Gaylord because they liked that name. Gaylord’s parents, Dave and Carol Williams, appeared extremely nervous when confronted by the media outside the Adair County Circuit Court this morning. Every year,  a few dozen young Americans launch civil lawsuits against their biological parents for various reasons. Many of these cases are cases designed as “wrongful birth lawsuits” and are often instituted by children with predictable birth defects.

This new picture taken in 1981 by a Kenyan diplomat has stirred outrage around the world, bringing reactions from several Canadian politicians as well as foreign leaders. The leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer, said the recent series of revelations about Justin Trudeau’s past tend to show a “darker and creepier side hidden behind his good-guy image”. Even U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the pictures and the scandal during a press conference this morning. A photo of Justin Trudeau at West Point Grey Academy’s Arabian Nights gala in April 2001 was the first of a series of picture suggesting Trudeau in racially sensible positions revealed over only a few days. Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada since 2015 and he has built his political career around his image of a modern open-minded politician. This series of pictures and videos which seems to become longer and more shocking every day has already affected his party, which was largely favorite for the upcoming election.

Jackhead | A Canadian trapper claims he has survived a brutal sexual assault by what he calls the “biggest beaver he has ever seen.”,"Bill O’Connor, 63, was checking his beaver traps near Lake Winnipeg when a large bear-like creature attacked him out of nowhere. O’Connor, who first thought he was being mauled by a small bear or wolverine, soon realized it was, in fact, a very large-sized beaver. The beaver, apparently bruised by one his traps, was extremely aggressive and even managed to knock the sixty-three-year-old man unconscious before he awoke minutes later. Moments later, the large-sized semiaquatic rodent eventually ejaculated on O’Connor’s head and neck, before leaving the area. Bill O’Connor, 63, told local reporters he had been mauled and sexually assaulted by what he believes to be a massive 200-pound beaver. Conservation officer, Tom McGreary, says visitors at the nearby Kinwow Bay Park Reserve have reported multiple sightings of an unusually large-sized beaver in the area. “We have also had several reports in the area by local residents of excessively large beavers but until now it had been more of a local legend,” he said when reached by phone. Beavers continue to grow throughout their lives and adult specimens weighing over 25 kg (55 lb) are not uncommon. The largest specimen ever recorded was captured in Red Lake, Ontario, in 1897 and weighed an impressive 107 kg (237 lb). Can you imagine having to endure the heckling you would receive when you told people you were raped by a Giant Beaver???

"Passengers of a cruise ship sailing off the coast of Hawaii had an extremely unpleasant surprise this morning, when chunks of frozen human waste fell on them from the sky.","A Boeing 777 airplane belonging to the Taiwanese airline EVA Air, dumped human excreta midair while traveling from Japan to Hawaii. Unfortunately, the content of the toilet tank was jettisoned into the sky while the plane was flying over the cruise liner  , which was hit by “large chunks of blue ice”. The top deck of the ship was literally covered with chunks of blue ice containing human excreta. Hundreds of passengers were standing on the top deck at the time, and many were hit by ice projectiles weighing up to 10 lbs. Janis Garrison, a passenger who witnessed the whole incident, says the ice appeared very suddenly and took everyone by surprise. Five passengers were critically injured and 18 more were severely hurt, but the ship’s medical staff intervened rapidly and was able to stabilize all of the victims. The ship was rapidly redirected to Hawaii to undergo some repair and to allow the injured passengers to obtain better medical care. Some of them could need weeks of care before they can go back to their regular life. 25-year old Jason Matthews was hit by a 12-lb chunk of ice and suffered a severe concussion. He still has no memory of the incident. North Pacific Cruise Lines, who own and operate the  , confirmed they would file a lawsuit against the Taiwanese airline. According to international law, dumping of lavatory waste is illegal, so EVA Air could also face some major fines. Despite regulations, many Asian airliners continue to jettison the content their toilet tanks over the Pacific Ocean, and even over land. In December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India ordered a fine of Rs. 50,000 on airlines emptying toilet tanks in the air, after a Delhi neighborhood was repeatedly hit by blue ice.

A former security guard in a Detroit laboratory has confessed to ejaculating in the sanitized tanks used to produce hydrating face cream on more than 500 occasions over the last three years.,"59-year old Larry Gordon was arrested this morning by officers of Detroit Police Department after he was caught on tape and confessed his actions to his employer. Mr. Gordon spent the last seven years working as a night watch at a lab owned by American Cosmetic Chemicals (ACC), a subcontractor for several companies including Cover Girl, Neutrogena, and Yves Rocher. He was recently caught by a video camera while masturbating in the cream tanks and was confronted by his employer. Faced with the gravity of his confession, the board of directors of the ACC immediately decided to suspend Mr. Gordon from his job and contact the police. The DPD led a rapid investigation and arrested Larry Gordon this morning under five charges of sexual assault, and some police sources say that many more charges could be filed over the next few days. Detroit police chief James Craig says the investigators take this case very seriously and that Mr. Gordon’s victims could number in the millions. It remains unclear at the moment which brands or products were contaminated by Mr. Gordon’s sperm, but an ACC spokesman tried to reassure the public by stating that the semen was only present in small quantities and represented no health hazard. The company says an investigation is underway to determine exactly which products were affected, but it admitted that between 500,000 and 3,000,000 customers may have bought contaminated cosmetics. Mr. Gordon’s lawyer, Ben Tillerman, says his client suffers from serious mental problems and has demanded a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is fit to stand a trial. The evaluation will take place as soon as the police investigation is completed and should take a few days, which means Mr. Gordon should make his first appearance in court next week.

"Tuscaloosa, AL | A well-known naturopath and former LGBT militant claims to have “cured himself” of his homosexuality by drinking two glasses of sperm per day for a few months.","61-year old Brian Franklin was for several decades militant and leader of several organizations working for the promotion of LGBT rights. He says despite his activism, he’s always felt uneasy about being gay and always hoped he could be cured. The professional naturopath said he spent years studying the nature of homosexuality and the chemical properties of thousands of substances. After several unsuccessful attempts with various herbs, he turned his attention to a substance which turned out to have an almost perfect chemical and hormonal properties: human semen. He created a solution composed of 95% pure human semen, in which a mix of vitamin and hormones is added. Some preliminary tests with rats produced some very promising results, so Mr. Franklin decided to test it himself. Over the last year, he ingested two glasses (600 ml) of this treatment every day and he says the results are conclusive. Mr. Franklin is convinced that this new scientific breakthrough could help millions of homosexuals around the world. According to the preliminary studies, the effects of this new semen treatment are reversible and showed that the subjects reverted to their homosexual ways in less than a month if they stop the treatment. Mr. Franklin is waiting for FDA’s approval before he can sell his semen treatment in the U.S., but he’s confident that it should be approved over the next few months. Like every claim concerning a possible cure for homosexuality, Mr. Franklin’s treatment was greeted with a lot of skepticism by the scientific community. Several experts have dismissed the treatment as “ridiculous” or as a “quackery”, and many insist that homosexuality isn’t a disease and cannot be cured. Many LGBT organizations have also publicly denounced Brian Franklin, calling him a “fraud”, a “homophobe” and a “traitor to all gays”. Despite all these critics, the 61-year old man is convinced that his treatment will be a marketing success once the FDA approves it and says he’s impatient to begin production.

A man suffering from an eating disorder was hospitalized in a critical condition last night after his cravings led to ingest more than 60 deodorizer blocks designed for toilets.,"64-year old Marius Hanson, from Freeport in Illinois, works as a janitor in a retirement home and he was found unconscious around 11 PM last night by one of his coworkers. He’s known for suffering from binge eating disorder (BED), which has led him to eat compulsively several things on his worksite in the past, including toilet paper, plastic syringes, disposable diapers, and even a couple of mops heads. Eric Fraser, the colleague who found him inert next to an empty box of chemical deodorizers says he immediately realized what had happened. Mr. Fraser rapidly called 911 before performing a heart massage on his colleague until the paramedics arrived a few minutes later. Eric Fraser, the coworker who’s intervention saved Mr. Hansen’s life, says he had never realized that toilet deodorizers could be a threat, but that this incident made him see them differently. Luckily, Mr. Hansen was transported to the hospital, where doctors were rapidly able to stabilize him and treat his poisoning. He had even regained consciousness this morning and suffered from no apparent consequences from his ordeal. Every year, thousands of Americans are hospitalized due to the consequences of binge eating disorder, a problem estimated to affect around 90,000 across the U.S. While most of these cases involve actual food or at least edible items, several dozen cases every year involve non-edible or even poisonous products. Over the last few years, some cases have involved things as various as foam padding, cd’s, cigarette butts, nail varnish, and even lightbulbs. Even if most victims are able to survive and even cure of BED, more the 300 Americans die every year from eating dangerous or poisonous items. And why did they save this guy?

"Doha| A famous racehorse with an estimated value of more than 12 million American dollars, is to be euthanized on Friday, after it was allegedly caught in sexual intercourse with another stallion.","The 4-year old horse named Al-Hadiye (the Gift) is the property of the Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal. It earned more than 6 million USD during the last racing season alone, notably triumphing at the Saudi National Championship Show and the Qatar International Arabian Horse Show. The stallion was allegedly caught on two separate occasions by employees of the Prince’s corral, while it was engaged in sexual intercourse with another male. When this was reported to the authorities, the horse was rapidly taken away and isolated.  said the President of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Abdulrahman Al Alsanad.  The committee signed the famous horse’s death warrant in front of the television cameras. This was meant to send a clear message that homosexuality, under any form, would not be tolerated in the kingdom. Various organizations devoted to the rights of animals or homosexuals have denounced the committee’s decision and the constant persecution of gay animals in the kingdom. The American organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, better known under the abbreviation PETA, claims that the Saudi kingdom has one of the worst records in the world in terms of gay animal rights.   explains the PETA spokeswoman, Janet McIntyre. Almost a dozen American and European horse owners have also offered to buy the horse in order to prevent its execution, but so far, the kingdom has refused to negotiate. The execution is destined to take place on Friday, November 20. In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality is widely seen as an immoral and indecent activity, both for animals and humans. The kingdom’s law punishes acts of homosexuality or cross-dressing with imprisonment, fines, corporal punishment (like whipping or flogging) and even capital punishment. Combating homosexuality remains one of the major goals of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, along with its campaign against the consumption of alcohol and the practice of magic. Good for the Saudis, my neighbor had a gay son, they disowned him, it was the correct choice Are you kidding me. You see male dogs humping everything. You’ve seen horses mounting giant round bales of hay. They are horny stallions. Do they teally think they are choosing male or female. Omgod. Idiots. Im sure the only thing around was that male.

Dozens of trucks filled with manure showed up in front of the house around 6:00 this morning and began dumping their smelly cargo over the property’s lawn. George Fitzgerald, Mr. Morris’ former employer, was awakened by the sound of the vehicles on his property and rapidly called the police. Unfortunately, it took the police more than 15 minutes to arrive on the site, and more than 10,000 tons of manure had already been dumped in the meantime. Brian Morris was standing right across the street and laughing when the police arrived, and he rapidly came over to confess his responsibility and explain his motivations. Lieutenant Frank Meyers, a spokesman of the Clarendon Hills Police Department, met the press a few hours later to explain the motivations behind this strange crime. The Clarendon Hills Police Department admitted that its response time was inadequate and said it would keep a close eye on Mr. Morris to avoid any more incidents. Brian Morris had attracted a lot of media attention two weeks ago after winning $125 million at Powerball Multi-state lottery.

"Kansas City, MO | A 26-year-old morgue worker was arrested this morning after a DNA test revealed that her newborn child was the result of a necrophiliac intercourse with a man she was supposed to autopsy.","Jennifer Burrows, an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with dozens of corpses over the course of the last two years, a behavior which led the birth of a baby boy on January 7. According to the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, her baby is the son of a man who died in a car accident in March 2017, and whose body she was supposed to autopsy. They allege that Ms. Burrows sexually abused more than 60 other dead bodies, belonging to males aged from 17 to 71 years of age. Police Chief Forté told reporters. The KCMO Police Chief, Darryl Forté, briefly commented Ms. Burrows’ arrest this morning during a press conference, calling it “one of the most sordid cases he has seen in his career”. There are currently no laws (state or federal) governing or explicitly outlawing the practice of necrophilia since the corpse is considered human remains and no longer living. Therefore, it is technically legal in the state of Missouri, and Ms. Burrows’ actions are judged as an indecent treatment of a corpse. She is facing a total of 158 charges, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs. The psychologists and experts that we interviewed were divided in their interpretation of Ms. Burrows’ case. Some, like Professor Isabella Ramirez of the University of Missouri, believe that the young woman was suffering from a psychosis and had, at least partially, lost any notion of reality. Others, like Dr. Gerald Porter, a well-known psychologist and expert in sexual disorders associated with the Institute of Psychological Sciences, believe that the accused is clearly a compulsive necrophiliac and that her choice of profession was inspired by her sexual deviation in the first place. All seem to agree, however, that the 26-year-old woman was suffering from mental problems and that she will probably register a plea of insanity.

A Florida hospital is facing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit after one of his doctors negligently got his hand stuck in a patient’s rectal cavity for several hours after a prostate exam.,"51-year old Ronald Walters presented himself last week at the Orlando Regional Medical Center for a routine exam designed to detect prostate cancer. Unfortunately, the simple procedure rapidly took a dramatic twist when Dr. Bill H. Randall, who was performing the exam, got his right hand completely stuck in the patient’s rectum. The two men were stuck in this very uncomfortable position for several hours until a surgeon was called to perform an incision and free his colleague. Mr. Walters told MSNBC that he was immediately offered a financial compensation by the hospital, but preferred contacting lawyers to file a lawsuit. The 51-year old electrician says he intends to sue the hospital for more than $3 million once he recovers from his ordeal. The Orlando Regional Medical Center admitted that the doctor may have made a mistake during the procedure and announced that he would be suspended until the end of the investigation on the incident. The head of the medical staff at the Orlando Health Medical Center, Andrew Cheatham, met the media this morning to announce the temporary suspension of Dr. Randall and offer his sympathies to the patient. Prostate exams are extremely common medical procedures in most developed countries, and complications are extremely rare. Only one out of every 47,500 exams is reported to cause complications and most of these involve hemorrhoids or minor infections, often linked to insufficient sanitization. However, a few other incidents of negligence have been reported over the last few years, some leading to important financial compensations. In 2005, a Florida doctor lost a ring inside a patient’s rectum while performing a similar exam. A similar incident was reported in California in 2011 and lead to a $2.7M settlement.   I can see using two fingers to give the patient a second opinion, but a whole hand? That’s just overkill 10million dollars?. The trauma should be compensated, but he is still able bodied. The US’s suing culture has gone bonkers.

"Flint | 46-year old Randolf Turner, the manager of a Wendy’s restaurant in Michigan, is accused of stealing more than 32 tons of bacon from his employer over the last four years.","The man would have elaborated a complex plot to divert for his personal use, from 20 to 250 kilograms of meat per week, from shipments destined to his branch of the restaurant chain. The man allegedly took advantage of his position to falsify orders and sales in order to hide the disappearance of the bacon from the company accounts and used his knowledge and control of the security cameras to be able to retrieve his loot without appearing on the tapes. The company would have started to suspect Mr. Turner in December 2013 after an anonymous denunciation, and had some new security cameras installed without informing him. Over the next few weeks, they captured incriminating images of the manager taking 10-kilogram bags of bacon and leaving with them on a regular basis. They then interrogated a few of the branch’s employees and understood that clearly, something shady was going on. The company’s legal department then took the decision to transfer the case and the evidence to the police, who rapidly arrested the accused. Mr. Turner now faces multiple criminal charges of embezzlement, fraud, and larceny, and faces a sentence of up to 88 years in prison if found guilty on all charges. The accused has already been fired by for his employer as soon as the arrest took place. The corporation explained the decision to lay him off, by the fact that the events constitute a “major breach of trust” between Wendy’s and Mr. Turner. More and more cases of bacon theft have been reported over the country over the last years, and the police seem powerless to explain or to stop this new crime spree.

Chow’s lawyer, Justin Wang, told reporters that he was currently not aware of any concrete evidence that his client, who has been charged with animal cruelty, had sold dog meat but that if he had, it was only a cultural misunderstanding, he argued. Chow’s wife, Hu-Wen Zhao, believes the owner of the hot dog stand on the other side of the street has conspired against her husband to shut down his business. Killing dogs and cats for meat is still legal in 44 U.S. states but in the state of New York it is expressly prohibited for “any person to slaughter or butcher domesticated dogs or domesticated cats to create food, meat or meat products for human or animal consumption.” Xi Ping Chow immigrated to the United States in 1996 and has had a hot dog stand license in the Brooklyn area for the past 18 years.

Nearly 200 guests were present, including most of Hong Kong’s political and economic elite, when the celebrated, after a brief speech, opened a bottle of champagne and was hit violently in the head by the cork. Many witnesses actually laughed at first, greatly underestimating the severity of the injury,  but an eerie silence rapidly overcame the crowd as Mr. Loeng remained unconscious and the medical staff was urged on the site. Despite all the efforts of the paramedics, his death was confirmed less than twenty minutes later while he was being carried to the hospital. Many of the guests who had laughed at first, were visibly emotional after the announcement of Mr. Loeng’s death. Rated the 51st richest in Hong Kong according to the Forbes business magazine, Mr. Loeng was an eccentric real estate tycoon who made a fortune in some very controversial deals in the years preceding the transfer of sovereignty of the former British colony to China. Even if his fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion dollars, the Hong Kong businessman was always better known for his various antics  and legal problems than for his economic activities. According to the police, the champagne bottle could have been a Chinese counterfeit, an explanation that seems more than plausible for the exceptionally high level of carbon dioxide contained in it. The problem of counterfeit alcohol has become a major concern for the Chinese authorities over the last few years, as the quantity of forged liquors and wines has been soaring. Many experts estimate that as much as 80 per cent of the alcohol in most Chinese cities is fake, mostly using counterfeit branding, where spoiled, low grade bottles of wine are sold as the real deal, yielding unreal margins. The owners and staff of the hotel,  refused to comment the event or the accusation of selling couterfeit alcohol. A champagne cork in full flight won’t kill you , but it can pop an eye out of it’s socket….

Kathmandu | A tourist expedition in the Himalayas turned to nightmare after an American tourist and two local guides were savagely attacked by a creature resembling a “hairy” and “giant” humanoid reports the Kathmandu Herald.,"Jason Barclay, 28, was on a solo adventure across the Himalayas with his two local sherpas when he was attacked during the night by what he believed was a bear. The creature lashed through his tent and started to shove the half-asleep man around, who managed to stay still despite his fear. Barclay finally realized the creature was, in fact, not a bear when he came into direct eye contact with the beast. The creature then attempted some form of sexual interaction with him, involving humping and loud moaning, recalled the victim. Pushpa Deuba, one of the two sherpas accompanying Barclay, lies in critical condition after he came to Barclay’s rescue by making loud noises with some pans and was briefly attacked by the creature. Although it was dark and the attack occurred at night, both sherpas believe it was a yeti and not a bear, as bears do not climb at those altitudes they explained to the Kathmandu Herald. Jason Barclay has also kept some specimen of the semen for scientific analysis but says no serious research group has shown any interest at the moment. Although yeti is believed to be a legendary creature of the Himalayan regions, hundreds of encounters are nonetheless reported to local authorities by mountain climbers each year. WoW he tasted the Yeti’s semen? Now that is weird!!! this hoe got a big toe. sorry yett. a sequel to broke back mountain heath ledger back for more Your email address will not be published.

"Orlando, FL | A woman has been arrested and charged on multiple accounts of child abuse and neglect after tying a one-month-old baby to a ceiling fan.","Nora Jackson, 28, was contacted and hired on Craigslist to take care of a one-month-old baby after the parents had planned to take a day off. Parents of the one-month-old child contacted the Orlando Police Department when they arrived at their residence to find their baby had been tied and suspended from the ceiling fan. Camera surveillance footage contradicted Nora Jackson’s story that she had only suspended the child to the ceiling fan for a few minutes, but instead for 26 hours straight, commented Deputy Sheriff Neil James. Although the child is currently under medical watch, doctors believe the baby will not suffer from any permanent damage. Nora Jackson finally admitted that she was intoxicated and under the influence of crystal meth, alcohol and crack cocaine before she decided to suspend the one-month-old baby to the ceiling fan to stop him from crying. Jackson also left the home during the night to attend a party elsewhere and lost the keys and address to the house where she had left the baby. Orlando police later arrested Jackson at her home where she first denied being hired on Craigslist as a babysitter but later admitted to the whole story. Jackson is now facing multiple accounts of child abuse and neglect and could face up to 15 years in jail if convicted. You are a fucking idiot if you think its OK to leave a baby suspended from a spinning ceiling fan on maximum for 26 hours straight, no food no milk and a pissy diaper straight pathetic 🚮🚮🚮 Unless the parents have left explicit instruction on what not to do, then the baby sitter cannot be faulted. Doctor said there was no permanent damage. Baby probably enjoyed it. Can’t understand the fuss. Did not harm the baby. No drugs. No molestation. Nothing. Just an innovative way to stop the crying.

"Seventeen people were arrested and a large amount of drugs were seized during an undercover operation targeting DEA special agents during a formal Drug Enforcement Administration employee party, officials said Thursday.","About 50 law enforcement officers, the Department of Public Safety, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Richmond and Roanoke police departments participated in the drug-trafficking investigation. The investigation focused on a number of corrupted members of the Drug Enforcement Administration who are suspected of laundering more than $170 million in illicit drug proceeds, according to a news release from the Roanoke County Sheriff’s Office. The arrest led to the seizure of about 47 pounds of methamphetamine, 30 pounds of cocaine, 13 pounds of heroin, 20 pounds of marijuana, a half-pound of fentanyl and 600 oxycodone pills. Top DEA officials got suspicious when a woman unrelated to the agency was evacuated last year from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s main office by ambulance after suffering a drug-related overdose. “One prostitute had to leave in an ambulance because they had put so much cocaine in her vagina that she overdosed,” the former DEA agent explained. It is estimated that since 2001 the Drug Enforcement Administration has seized over 237 million pounds of illicit drugs, although a recent 2016 DEA internal investigation revealed that more than 67% of these narcotics were found to be “untraceable, unaccounted for and or misplaced.” WHAT IS 67% OF, TWO HUNDRED AND 37 MILLION POUNDS OF DOPE??

The 60s were the good old days and I did a great Johnny Cash impression which played out real good with the ladies,” he explained. Author Anthony Kendall has teamed up with private investigator Sid Roy and will publish the results of the 15-year investigation next fall in an upcoming book Private investigator Sid Roy could never have imagined a simple gig would end up in a 15-year quest for the truth. “That is when the mystery started unraveling and it became a personal mission of mine, whenever I had some free time, I’d try and track down other testimonies.” “Eventually, DNA testing became really cheap and easy to use and helped me gather a lot of information in the latest years,” he acknowledged. The private investigator says the children of the old man don’t intend to pursue any lawsuit against the old man. “The truth unleashed could break up hundreds or more families and that’s definitely not the point of all these years of research. All I know is that most people are glad to know the truth and don’t bear any grudge against the old man, I guess it was a more common practice in those days,” he acknowledges. “I’ve spent 15 years of my own personal time into this, I think it’s enough,” he admits. “But my research clearly shows there could be many more children,” he told local reporters, although he declined to comment if the numbers were in the hundreds or thousands more. io sono vostra mamma Your email address will not be published.

Houston police have arrested a man believed to be behind the disappearance of no less than 31 persons this past decade.,"Ivan Fedorovitch Yanukovych, 56, could be linked to a number of mysterious disappearances in the area believe officials. Yanukovych was interrogated by police after neighbors complained about him using a chainsaw late at night and reported the man being “covered in blood.” When police arrived on the scene, Yanukovych was found butchering a dead body in his garage and preparing what police officers described as “large quantities of ground meat” mixed in with an “aromatic blend of spices.” Executive Assistant Chief Buchanan from the Houston Police Department says officials seized over 700 pounds of “unidentified meat” from four freezers and which is presumed to be of human origin. Yanukovych, 56, who lives with his mother, Anastasia Z. Yanukovych, 93, and who rents the house basement to a local student, seemed to blend into the community and never arouse suspicion from neighbors. When interrogated by authorities, Yanukovych apparently showed some remorse about killing the delivery men and postmen who were “just doing their job” but said the Jehovah witnesses “really annoyed him” and wished he had “taken more out.” Tom Duvall, a local Jehovah witness organization spokesman, said that he is relieved that “members of our local chapter can now feel safe” and that “these courageous souls have not ended in this vile man’s belly, but in God’s belly.” If convicted of his crimes, Ivan Fedorovitch Yanukovych faces a maximum prison sentence of 2,675 years in jail, believe experts.

At first, I was curious, but eventually I became scared when they started getting agitated” she recalls, visibly traumatized by the latest events. “It all happened in a flash, all I remember is the horrifying sight of the manatees trying to grab me and force me into submission. Luckily, a man on a jet ski caught their attention and scared them away moments before the Coast Guard rescued me,” she told local reporters. A herd of male manatees possibly mistook the vacationer for a female manatee, a rare phenomenon as manatees are usually shy creatures The sexual assault of the herd of manatees on a human being could be explained by the menstrual cycle of the vacationer, believes Jane Keller, professor of biology at the University of South Florida. “ Tyler Smith, a 17-year-old lifeguard present during the sexual assault, believes she is lucky to be alive.

"El Paso | A group of Minutemen watching the Mexican Border for illegal migrants and drug traffickers, have proceeded to the citizen arrest of two men in an SUV, carrying 1300 pounds of cocaine.","The volunteers were completely astonished when the two arrestees pulled out CIA ID cards and explained they were actually carrying the drug as part of their duties and that the cargo belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency. The incident took place last night, in the Chihuahuan desert, near the Texan city of El Paso. A group of seven Minutemen saw a large black SUV drive rapidly across the border. They chased the vehicle in their own trucks and achieved to immobilize it after a chase of more than 15 miles. The vigilantes arrested the two men on board and called the border patrol, who proceeded to search the vehicle. They discovered dozens of packages of cocaine, totaling an incredible 618.4 kilograms (1363 pounds). The search of the vehicle revealed 36 packages of cocaine, all marked with the symbol of the Sinaloa Cartel, representing a black scorpion. The two men claim to be CIA operatives based in Mexico and explained that the drug was actually part of an operation of the agency. They presented identity cards that seem to validate their claim, but the CIA spokesperson, Dean Boyd, has officially denied any link between the organization and the two men. Both the border patrol officers and minutemen seem unconvinced, however, and many of them seem to believe that the secret service agency is hiding something. The U.S. custom services have even announced a thorough investigation to try and verify the two men’s story. The custom services have confirmed that the two men, who can’t be identified due to the Intelligence Identities and Protection Act of 1982, did carry valid CIA identifications and that the vehicle was indeed registered as a service vehicle of the organization. The two men remain under the custody of the customs services at the moment and are still being interrogated in a facility near El Paso. They are facing charges of possessing, trafficking and importing illegal drugs, and could face other criminal charges once the investigation is over. Both the FBI and the DEA have announced that they would collaborate with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in this case, which as already attracted a lot of attention in Southern Texas. This is why the government wants no wall. Boyd stated, ” CIA doesn’t take part in drug smuggling operations along US-Mexico border”. Watch the wording. Besides that, I was in Central America in the 80’s, CIA not involved my a$$! The shipments for the DNC convention are starting to arrive.

A Canadian man was arrested by the FBI this morning near Burlington and accused of performing acts of industrial espionage and sabotage against dozens of maple sugar shacks across Maine and Vermont.,"39-year old Andrew King, officially a representative for the Ontario Maple Syrup Producers Association, is suspected of being an agent of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. An investigation led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has linked him to at least 42 acts of sabotage committed over the last two months on sugar shacks across Maine and 27 across Vermont. According to FBI spokesman Arthur Haroldson, the methodical destruction of the American maple syrup production capacity was ordered by the Canadian government to retaliate for American tariffs on steel and aluminum. Mr. Haroldson says investigators were able to identify the suspect after decrypting coded messages he allegedly hid in image files he shared on Instagram. The Canadian government has denied any link with the suspect, describing him as “a nationalist extremist known for his mental problems”. FBI spokesman Arthur Haroldson says investigators rapidly identified Canada as the primary suspect, allowing them to concentrate their efforts and act rapidly to end the sabotages. Andrew King now faces federal charges for espionage and acting as a foreign agent, as well as a total of 237 criminal charges. Due to the nature of the charges, his trial will be held behind closed doors and is set to begin next week. If found guilty, he could face the death penalty, but as is common in the world of espionage, he may also be exchanged for one or more of the four American spies actually detained in Canada. Whatever the outcome, this incident will certainly put some additional stress on the already tensed relation between the longtime allies. Your email address will not be published.

Ürümqui | A group of coal miners from the western province of Xinjiang had an unbelievable surprise when the gallery they were excavating opened up on a section of an old mine that was abandoned 17 years ago after an earthquake that caused some large sections of the tunnels to collapse.,"While they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape. Wai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks. The poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse. Wai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case. Even though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act. Mining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium. Over the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines. The closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics. The former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith.

The security guards first thought Mr. Smith had either eaten the pumpkin or flushed it down the toilet, but they soon noticed that she was sweating heavily and looked very uncomfortable. James Reynolds, one of the security guards who intercepted Ms. Smith says he was in disbelief when he understood where she had put it. The two security guards called the Greenville Police Department who rapidly proceeded to a cavity search and discovered the pumpkin. Mr. Reynolds says the officers dispatched on the site thought they were being pranked when they first explained the situation. The squash showed extremely difficult to extract and the 31-year-old woman had to be transported to the hospital, where it was finally removed after a delicate two-hour surgery. The security guard who intercepted the pumpkin thief described the incident as “extremely disturbing” and the worst thing he’s seen since he started doing this job 13 years ago.

Mr. McKensie says his friend rapidly emerged from the water, screaming from pain, but he had already been hit by several harpoons. The fishermen finally understood that Mr. Smith wasn’t a shark and they rapidly carried him to the shore and called for help. The young man was transported to six hours he Pattaya International Hospital, where doctors finally able to stabilize him after six hours of intensive care. Thai national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung said he was “very happy” to hear that the victim had survived. He declared that the fishermen who injured the young American man acted to defend the swimmers and no charges will be filed against them. Fake shark fins have been popular items among pranksters for more than twenty years, and have caused several unfortunate incidents. In 2009, two women were severely injured in Australia after being trampled by a group of swimmers running away from a man with a fin. In 1996, a man was hit by 16 bullets and killed in Florida after approaching a private beach while wearing a fake shark fin. Despite numerous accidents and warnings from authorities, many thrill seekers continue to buy and wear these items to try and scare their friends and family. Sounds like he deserved it… Actually we should be condemning the killers who shoot before thinking. Firstly they didnt kill anyone. And even if they did, blame the prankster.

"A detainee’s attempt to escape from the Jessup Correctional Institution in Maryland ended tragically Yesterday, as the man who was hiding inside a cadaver bag was accidentally cremated alive by county morgue employees.","41-year old Gary Smith had served 18 months of a 12-year sentence for a series of armed robberies committed in 2014 and had been in Jessup for only five months, after attempting to escape from the Brockbridge Correctional Facility earlier this year. Mr. Smith allegedly took advantage of the demise of another detainee, somehow disposing of the body and hiding inside the body bag himself in order to fool prison security and leave the perimeter of the prison. The first part of his plan worked perfectly, but unfortunately for him, he seems to have fallen asleep or lost consciousness during his transport to the county morgue. It was only when they launched the cremation process and heard horrifying screams that the staff noticed something was wrong, but it was already too late. The director of the Howard County Morgue’s Medical Examiner’s Office, Terence Anderson, described the horrifying screams that he and his colleagues heard. Mr. Anderson says it’s surprising that the detainee didn’t run away before the cremation, saying he’d been left alone on a stretcher for more than three hours before the process began. The Howard County Sheriff’s Office and the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have announced a joint investigation to determine the exact circumstances of Mr. Smith’s escape and death. The director of the morgue, Mr. Terence Anderson, says the employees tried to stop the process when they heard screams, but the furnace had already reached a temperature of 1,800 °F (980 °C) and the poor man was dead before they could intervene. Accidental cremations of living individuals are rather rare across the United States, with an average of only seven cases reported annually. In most of these cases, the victims are comatose hospital patients misidentified as dead by the medical staff. Mr. Smith’s case is considered “extremely concerning” by the state’s Medical Examiner’s Office which also launched an internal investigation to make sure that this kind of accident doesn’t happen again. Saved tax payers alot of money, it is a bad way to go… But so is being a baby inside your mother and being cut into pieces, or snatched out..One he broke the law several times, and this was his 2nd escape attempt.. But it was his last.when a Abortion happens OR MURDER..ITS TO A PURE INNOCENT BABY. Murder. Should of made sure the body was deceased before cremation. R.IP.

"As North Korea’s nuclear program is drawing a lot of attention and causing tension among the world’s superpowers, a teenager from Concord in New Hampshire has created 45-kiloton atomic bomb for her school’s science fair.","14-year old Kathryn Simmons is one of the 137 students who were participating this week, in this year’s New Hampshire State Junior Science Fair. Daughter of a Marine Captain and an aeronautic engineer, she decided to present a complete A-bomb as her project in order to “show people that these things aren’t so dangerous”. She says building a bomb is hardly more complicated and dangerous than building a dishwasher. She hopes that her bomb will show people that atomic bombs are “simple machines like any others” and help the public be less afraid of nuclear weapons. Kathryn’s science teacher, Ronald Terrence, says he’s impressed by what she was able to accomplish with the materials that she found at the hardware store. Despite numerous critics from parents and teachers alike, Kathryn Simmons’ project earned the first place in the New Hampshire State Science Fair. Her A-bomb will now be presented during the National Junior Science Fair, which will be held in Denver, in January. A few organizations, including Greenpeace, have announced their intentions to disturb the event if her “weapon” is exhibited. Despite these threats, Kathryn says she’s determined to “be in Denver and win.” This isn’t the first time that a controversial school project stirs a controversy in the United States.

All of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him and punched him in the face. While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls. Mr. Whitaker immediately reported the attack to both the Glenwood Springs Police Department (GSPD) and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency and a joint investigation has been launched. Investigators found some extremely large footprints on the site, which they believe are those of the aggressor. Darrel Whitaker is convinced that the creature who attacked him was a sasquatch, but the GSPD investigators say it’s more probable that the attacker is simply a particularly large and hairy man. They are currently interrogating nearby residents to see if anyone noticed an individual corresponding to the description of the suspect.

"A man turned himself in to the police in Jerusalem this morning, claiming he’s not only a time traveler but also the killer of Jesus Christ.","The Jerusalem District Police has confirmed that an unidentified man dressed in a Roman armor presented himself this morning in its headquarters,  carrying a blood-covered spear-like weapon. The man, who speaks only in Latin, identified himself as the Roman centurion Caius Longinus Anxanumus and claimed to be a time traveler from the first century AD. According to police spokesman Jacob Levine, the man claims he’s the killer of Jesus Christ and that the weapon he carried is the one the “Holy Lance” that pierced the Christ in his side during the Crucifixion. The man also claimed that God tormented and tortured him for almost 2000 years to punish him for his crimes. The Jerusalem District Police believes the man might suffer from schizophrenia or similar mental issue and are asking the public for help in identifying him. He measures 1m74 and weights 64 kilograms. He brown hair and brown eyes and speaks Latin perfectly. He also has the letters “SPQR” tattoed on his left arm. Chief of Police, Roni Alsheich, says that the individual isn’t filed in any of Israel’s mental institutions and believes that he might be a foreigner. According to experts, it is not uncommon for schizophrenic individuals to have delusions that they are important historical or religious figures like Napoleon, Jesus or George Washington. However, patients suffering from this phenomenon called Grandiose delusion, rarely identify themselves with characters of secondary importance, making this case quite unique. Longinus is a mythical figure in Christianity described in Christian tradition as the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus in his side with a lance, the “Holy Lance” during the Crucifixion. His name isn’t clearly stated in the Bible, but the different Christian traditions have developed several stories around him. He is traditionally venerated as a saint and martyr by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and several other Christian communions, even if very little is known about him. Hahahahaha!

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe.","Mr. Hodges, who worked for the CIA for 41 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often employed as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the security of the country.  Trained as both a sniper and a martial arts expert, Mr. Hodges says he also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons and explosives. Mr. Hodges swears he remembers vividly, each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA.  He claims that all 37 of the murders he committed on the American soil, were ordered by his commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.

The 78-year old man was placed under custody by the FBI, which is taking Mr. Hodges’ confession very seriously and has opened an investigation to verify his allegations.

"The conservative Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is slowly but surely opening to an increased role for women in society, as for the first time in the country’s history, an important religious leader has declared it possible for women to be admitted into Heaven.","In a sermon he delivered at the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by “Mahram relatives” (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law). This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the country’s traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances. She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair confirmed his position yesterday, during a panel of discussion on the role of women in Islamic society. He declared that he was convinced that “more than a few” Muslim women who were “good wives and good mothers”, have already been admitted into Heaven. A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the country’s ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imam’s sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that “only men are worthy of going to Heaven”. The scholars said that many deviant groups and individuals over the centuries have been responsible for the spreading such false beliefs, which are not part of the teaching of Islam. They advised all Muslims to “keep away from all the rituals and beliefs which are unIslamic”. Minister of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Call and Guidance, Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh told the al-Watan newspaper that Sheikh Al-Budair would be allowed to continue preaching, but will now be closely watched. The simple fact that the progressive Imam wasn’t arrested, suggests that some influential members of the Royal family may have secretly come to his defense. Rumors have already begun to spread, relayed by the Saudi media, that Princess Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan, the King’s second wife and mother of the Crown Prince Mohammed, could have used her influence to keep the religious leader from being arrested. The controversy has drawn reactions from various groups in the region, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who promised to kill the Imam if he doesn’t withdraw his declaration. She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair is expected to preach again at the Prophet’s Mosque next Friday, and his sermon promises to draw a lot of attention from both the media and the religious authorities.

Also, the judge pointed out that, after going through the evidence and photos the husband had brought to court, the suffering was in part justified but still decided the woman should be administered 100 lashes as to prevent further “misunderstandings” between her and her husband. The husband was sentenced to pay 40 Riyal ($10 US dollars) and prevented to use any sort of glue or adhesive on his wife ever again. 100 lashes to avoid future misunderstandings is a little light.

"A young Saudi man was sentenced to death for blasphemy and idol worshipping this morning in Jeddah, after confessing on social media that he had undergone a series of plastic surgeries “in order to look like Prophet Muhammad”.","23-year old Abdulaziz Sudairi from the city of Najran near the Yemeni border has been sentenced to an extremely violent death:  suffer 200 lashes before being beheaded with a sword. The young man, well-known as an Instagram model throughout the Arab peninsula, traveled to Israël several times over the last two years to undergo a total of 23 plastic surgeries to modify his chin, cheekbones, ears, eyelids, nose, even his skin color. He had problems with Saudi authorities several times in the past, but a comment he posted on his Instagram account in June made him a  target of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, the Saudi Islamic police. Mr. Sudairi posted a picture of himself after his last surgery, adding an extremely controversial comment: He was arrested three days later by the religious police and was imprisoned and interrogated for several weeks before the beginning of his trial. According to the judgment of the Shariah court, by attempting to look like the Prophet, Abdulaziz Sudairi committed blasphemy, and idol worshipping, two crimes punishable by death according to Sharia law. The Sharia court of Jeddah declared Mr. Sudairi’s intention to look like the Prophet “a heinous blasphemy”, saying it was their duty to “behead the snake before it bit the kingdom”. The Saudi legal system is known to be extremely harsh and to include a large array of corporal punishments and controversial execution methods. Several violations of the Sharia law lead to sentences including amputations and floggings, or executions by beheading with a sword, stoning or even crucifixion. Several Human Rights organizations have denounced Mr. Sudairi’s sentence as “unjustified and unnecessarily cruel” but such critics are rarely taken seriously by the Saudi government. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were executed last year in the kingdom according to Human Rights Watch. how best can people avoid cancer, cause it sounds a serious problem to the entire universe Your email address will not be published.

An Iowa man who underwent surgery for a brain tumor last month woke up from the operation table believing he is a woman.,"Anthony Perk, 26, had a large malignant tumor that had spread to an estimated 53% of his brain and which had to be urgently removed. Doctors warned Perk before the operation that removing half of his brain could lead to severe impairment of his cognitive abilities and dramatically change the way his brain functioned but that the operation would save his life. Since the operation, Perk now believes his thought patterns and brain functions have changed his personality into that of a woman’s. Dr. Sacha Brezinsky at the Iowa Clinic for Neurological & Spinal Surgery Department claims that his patient is producing abnormally high levels of estrogen since the operation which could explain the physiological and personality changes. Perk’s girlfriend of 5 years, Alexandra Niles, has also noticed profound changes in her boyfriend’s personality. “He used to be really mellow, but now he constantly keeps nagging people all the time for the stupidest reasons. When the dishes are dirty, he just goes insane” she said when reached by phone. Although Niles admits that she has had to adapt to her boyfriend’s mood swings and erratic behavior, she says she doesn’t mind that he now prefers to dress up as a woman. “He used to hate shopping, but now he just can’t wait to go to the mall every week with me to get some new shoes or a nice dress. We even share jewelry and beauty tips, it’s just great,” she added, visibly enthused. Although Anthony Perk admits that some of his family, friends, and coworkers have had a hard time to adjust to his new personality, he believes that the fact that he dresses like a woman but is not a homosexual helps them be more understanding of his condition.

A man who tried to enlarge his genitals by inflating them with an air compressor was left completely emasculated and almost died after his penis exploded.,"37-year old Ryan Davies, from Paterson in New Jersey, was lying unconscious in a pool of blood when his wife found him last night, so she immediately called the paramedics. He was rapidly transported to the hospital where he arrived in critical condition, but doctors were finally able to stabilize him after a few hours. Upon regaining consciousness, he admitted that he had tried everything to enlarge his penis over the last two years, and had already invested $15,000 in pills and penile pumps, without success. He finally decided to try his industrial air compressor, and he insists that his genitals did enlarge during the first few seconds before they literally exploded. Despite this “partial success”, he has now lost more than 90% of his genitals and may suffer from critical consequences for the rest of his life. Dr. Michael Hart, who specializes in penile surgery, says Mr.Davies’ genitals are too damaged to be saved, but that he could eventually be grafted a new penis. This isn’t the third accident involving makeshift “penis enlargement devices” this month in New Jersey, and authorities fear this could be the consequences of a new trend. Dr. Michael Hart, one of the most renowned penile surgeon in the world, says this kind of incident is bound to happen more often over the next few years as men become increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals. Dr. Hart insists that men should never use improvised penis enlargement methods, and should consult a specialist to learn about effective treatments and possible surgeries. Last year, 7,357 men were hospitalized across the United States in relation to penis enlargement treatments or devices, an increase of 44% compared to 2016.

Farmington| A dairy farmer from a small town near the Great Salt Lake in Utah made an incredible discovery on his property while he was looking for one of his cows that had not returned.,"69-year-old Michael Woodson, found a 12-meter-long humpback whale laying lifeless in the middle of one of his fields, hundreds of kilometers away from its natural habitat. The Farmington City Police was called on the site to investigate since the farmer thought that the cetacean could have been left there as a creepy prank by some neighborhood youngsters. The investigators rapidly dismissed the possibility, however, as no traces of vehicles or machinery large enough to carry it were found anywhere near the animal. The police admit that they are almost clueless at the moment as to how the marine mammal found its way on Mr. Woodson’s property. “We have to admit that we find this case very puzzling,” said Captain Terry Dawson from the Farmington police. “It is certainly the first time that we see anything like this in our city, and we have very little information for now as to how the animal got there.” A few witnesses have reported seeing some strange flying object in the area over the last two days and the authorities have confirmed that the 911 operators have received a few dozen calls from all over the region reporting such sightings, but they refuse to link both events for the moment. Michael Woodson still believes that some neighborhood youngsters placed the 25-ton animal there as a prank. A team of biologists from the University of Utah has already been called on the site to examine the body of the whale and realize various tests and analysis before it is removed from Mr. Woodson’s property. The scientists are trying to determine if the animal could have actually lived in the Great Salt Lake which is only a few kilometers away from the farm. The various police forces of the area are now asking the public to report any information that could prove helpful in solving this strange case.

"Beijing | Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this week and expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.","More than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened. These allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang’e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon. Several high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an “elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America’s space program capabilities”. Former top Chinese Communist Party official Bao Tong has been openly critical of the Apollo space program after pictures taken from China’s Chang’e-4 probe allegedly show no proof whatsoever of the American Moon landings ever happening These recent allegations have given credence to conspiracy theorists who have been claiming for decades that America has never gone to the Moon. Conspiracy theorists believe that president Richard Nixon pushed the agenda of a fake Apollo program to fool USSR into the Space Race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining the USSR. The Apollo program was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. No other country has since landed a human on the Moon, although several countries, such as Russia and China, are expected to plan missions beyond 2030. The Moon Landing movie was made in Hollywood.

"Memphis, TN | A group of volunteers cleaning up the shores of the Mississippi River near the biggest city in Tennessee have stumbled upon the remains of an ancient boat encrusted in mud.","A team of archeologists from the University of Memphis that was rapidly called to the site, confirmed that the ship is most certainly a Viking Knarr, suggesting the Norse would have pushed their exploration of America a lot further than historians previously thought. The heavily damaged ship was found near the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers and lies on a private property. Knarrs were naval vessels that were built by the Norsemen from Scandinavia and Iceland for Atlantic voyages but also used for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during an era known as the Viking Age, that goes approximately from 793 to 1066 AD. They were clinker built, which means the overlapping of planks riveted together. It was capable of sailing 75 miles (121 km) in one day and held a crew of about 20 to 30 men. One of the only artifacts on the site, this sword was probably abandoned after it broke, suggesting a violent battle. This new discovery could be one of the oldest evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, and it certainly brings to mind the famous colony of “Vinland” mentioned in the  This mythical colony would have been established by Leif Ericson around the same period as the settlement at l’Anse aux Meadows, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the most famous site of a Norse or Viking settlement in North America outside Greenland. The carbon dating of the new ship estimates that it dates from between 990  and 1050 AD, approximately the period associated with Vinland and the various Canadian sites (L’Anse aux Meadows, Tanfield Valley, Avayalik Islands). Unfortunately, very few other artifacts have yet been found on the site, suggesting the crew must have most likely abandoned the ship and continued on foot. Professor James Milbury, who leads the research team working on the site, believes the Norse could have been killed by Chickasaw natives. More searches are to be expected in the area over the next few years, as scientists will now certainly try to look for any artifacts or historical traces that could lead them to understand what happened to the crew of the ship. Many myths from local native tribes will also be analyzed by historians from the team to see if they could hold useful information, as both Chickasaw and Choctaw mythologies include many stories of fights against “red-haired devils”. There is a Viking grave in Van Buren Arkansas, near the Arkansas River close to the Oklahoma border. Viking evidence can be found everywhere … My heritage … I’m speechless.

A New York rabbi known for his ultra-Orthodox stance on circumcision is facing charges stemming from a number of complaints received by the New York Police Department.,"Rabbi Aaron Zayin was arrested last week after exchanging messages with a federal agent posing as a Craigslist user interested in purchasing “fresh baby foreskins,” according to the criminal complaint. Rabbi Zayin is believed to have sold an estimated 5,200 foreskins since 2015 when he started selling the pieces of human skin on Craigslist and advocating their aphrodisiac qualities as well as their miraculous cancer curing and longevity effects. Although there is no law pertaining to the selling of human skin or foreskin, Zayin’s claims that his product could cure a number of diseases such as hemorrhoids, chronic flatulence, erectile dysfunction, and cancer made him liable to criminal charges explained New York Police Department spokesman P.J. Hustler. To supply to the demand, Rabbi Zayin would perform up to 40 Brit Milah’s a day, also known as “covenant of circumcision” in the Jewish faith, at his synagogue but also in his home garage, as well as local restaurants and even in public washroom areas. “He harassed me and forced my poor son to have three circumcisions in three years. He barely has any skin left on his genitals,” one mother told reporters in tears. All products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, mitigate or cure cancer must first be reviewed and approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy reasons and can be dangerous to both people and pets. If convicted, Zayin could face a $500,000 fine and up to 1,087 years in jail according to current New York state laws, believe experts. No one should ever be circumcised without first giving their permission when a legal adult, religious or not. It’s cruel, unfair and unnecessary. Hospitals shouldn’t be asking parents if they want it done. Girls are federally protected, why aren’t boys? Sorry for your child. We are all victims of the scumbag doctors and/or Rabbis.

Dr. Andre van der Merwe of the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, admits it took 18 months until a suitable donor was found. “Usually we do transplants from dead bodies to living bodies but in this case, the donor is still alive,” he told the Cape Town Herald. “We ran ads in national newspapers and finally found a number of suitable matches for Mr. Phang with whom he arranged a financial agreement,” he added. Dr. Andre van der Merwe also warns that the procedure is expensive and not for everyone. “There are many risks involved, such as rejection of the organ by the body or surgical complications,” he admits. “There is also a period of adaptation, most people are not used to carrying such a heavy load,” he laughs. This is not the first transracial penis transplant as the same team of surgeons from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Tygerberg Hospital successfully transplanted a white penis on a black man who had lost his penis during a botched circumcision 17 years earlier.

"ITALY | Anatolia Vertadella, a 101-year-old Italian woman, has given birth to a 9-pound baby after a controversial ovary transplant","The illegal and controversial surgical operation was done in a private clinic in Turkey, where European laws on ovary transplants do not apply, admits the centennial mother who does not wish to disclose the name of the clinic where the operation was undertaken. “I am very grateful to all the team of doctors who decided to go on with the operation,” she admitted in tears. “For so long I have felt useless to God, I could not procreate since I turned 48 years old when I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. For a long time I believed God was punishing me for only bearing 16 children, but in his godly generosity, he has granted me with fertility once again,” acknowledges the century-old fervent Catholic. Dr. Alexandro Popolicchi fully endorses the controversial ovary transplant, which is deemed illegal under European health laws, and which was undertaken in a private clinic in Turkey where such laws do not apply Although he admits the procedure is highly controversial, Dr. Popolicchi believes the ultimate decision was up to his patient to make. “Who am I to judge if it is the proper thing to do? She has given birth to a beautiful baby and this miraculous birth is definitely a gift from God!” he told reporters. “So many children are born in this world unwanted or by accident. Is it not a beautiful thing to know this child comes to life in a loving home?” he asked reporters. Although Miss Vertadella’s husband has passed away since 1998, the century-old widow has managed to find a sperm donor to make the birth possible. “I met Francesco’s father on the internet while trying to find a father to my child. This 26-year-old man is a Catholic and that is all that is important to me. I wanted my child to be born in a union sanctified by the Catholic church” she explained. “I know we are not married and that he will not play a part in Francesco’s life, but I have written to the pope to ask for his absolution. I have also named my child after the pope in his honor and so I believe he should find a place in his heart to forgive me in this particular situation” she added with a prayer. “I still love my deceased husband and desire to stay a widow until I leave this earth, but I needed the seed of this young fervent Catholic to fulfill God’s will,” she concluded. Malegwale Ramokgopa allegedly gave birth to her 25th and 26th child in 1931 at the venerable age of 92 The world’s oldest mother was previously believed to be Malegwale Ramokgopa, a woman born in South Africa in 1839 who allegedly gave birth to twins three days after celebrating her 92nd anniversary on October 3, 1931, which made nation-wide headlines at the time. I see it differently. no it’s not selfish or greed. explain what i mean is selfish, actually is young unsettled women having children. and e.g. women who haven’t felt accomplished in career roles having children commentable. although the parent won’t see child grow up. this child was born out of planned love thats different like. the phrase being should this have been allowed. all depends upon angle seeing the subject from. bruh she a skeleton periotttt!!!! old ass lady doing workkkk what the fuck god Your email address will not be published.

"Doha, Qatar | Customs officers at the Hamad International Airport, in the Qatari capital, have arrested a Yemeni man attempting to smuggle more than 12 kilograms (27 lbs) of sliced bacon hidden in his anal cavity.","53-year old Abd al Rahman Shamoun was spotted by a specially trained police dog, looking for drugs or pork meat on passengers and in their luggage. He appeared visibly nervous and sweaty, so the customs took him in a separate office for a more thorough search and investigation. The search revealed 4 larges condoms hidden in his anal cavity, each containing more than 3 kilograms of bacon. In a press conference this morning, the Qatar Police Force presented the smuggled bacon and announced it had launched an investigation to determine if Mr. Shamoun was part of a larger bacon trafficking network. People ingesting or inserting illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons in various cavities, is a rather common practice and airports around the world are used to dealing with such cases. This is the first time, however, that bacon is discovered during a cavity search. Due to Qatar’s strict laws regarding pork meat and other food that isn’t “permissible” or “allowed” in Islam, Mr. Shamoun faces some very serious criminal charges. Accused of “possession of controlled substances”, “trafficking controlled substances” and “illegal importation of controlled substances”, he could now face the death penalty, with a minimum of 50 lashes and 15 years in prison.

Several students at a Dallas high school were transported to the hospital after an accidental showing of pornographic material during a sexual education class.,"17 students at St-Mary of Grace High School suffered post-traumatic shock, severe anxiety, breathing anomalies and one case of epilepsy was also reported, claim officials. A substitute teacher at St-Mary of Grace High School, who has now been suspended without pay, apparently left the class unattended for a couple of minutes and put one of the students in charge while he was gone. The student allegedly tried to continue teaching the class by showing some videos available on the teacher’s computer and accidentally fell upon pornographic videos which were shown on a projector to the whole class. Traumatized students who accidentally witnessed the pornographic material saw several of their comrades taking off to the hospital after suffering from various health complications. St-Mary of Grace High School’s sexual education class was a pilot project offered for the first time this year and that prides itself on emphasizing abstinence until marriage, one representative of the school explained. “Although this tragic situation may leave some of our students scarred for life, let’s hope that this will prevent kids from experiencing ideas of interracial relationships and sexual thoughts before marriage” explained Dolores Harding, the school principal. The State of Texas does not require any sex or HIV education to be taught in public schools, yet if a school chooses to teach these topics, it is required to emphasize abstinence until marriage. This was just downright awful. It was a christian church for the love of god! (No pun intended) I’m already asexual so this would just make me even more disgusted if I was there.

,"Mr Fitzgerald was shooting a documentary film on Burchell’s zebras along with two other National Geographic employees and five local guides, when he left the group to “get a closer look” of the animals. A few minutes later, his colleagues went looking for him and found him engaging in sexual intercourse with one of the animals. According to the South African Police Service (SAPS), 32-year old Brian Fitzgerald, from Morristown in New Jersey, lured a young male zebra with pieces of fruits before tying it down with a rope and sodomizing it. There is no specific legislation against bestiality in South Africa, but due to the circumstances, Mr Fitzgerald is accused of violating the Animals Protection Act, which makes it an offense to ill-treat, torture or terrify an animal. If found guilty, he faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The South African National Police Commissioner, Lt. Gen. Khomotso Phahlane, says charges were filed because the animal “obviously didn’t consent” to engage in sexual intercourse. The Executive director of the National Council of Societies for the Protection of Animals (NSPCA), Marcelle Meredith, says she wasn’t surprised when she learned about Mr Fitzgerald’s case. She claims that South Africa has become a popular destination for zoophiles over the last few years, despite the authorities’ efforts to crack down on the phenomenon. In recent years there have been the cases of a Transkei man sentenced to 12 months’ jail for having sex with a sheep; some Grahamstown youths caught “gang raping” a dog; and a 23-year-old Free State farm worker arrested when he was spotted by passing motorists while standing on a dunghill with his trousers around his knees, having intercourse with a cow. Despite the increasing number of accusations, the NSPCA estimates that more than 20,000 animals have been sexually abused in the country over the last two years. Must be an England fan reporting, Utterly repulsive humans raping animals poor zebra probably caught an STD from the bile diseased camera guy!

"A Mississippi man who was sold to a traveling circus at the age of three in 1993 by his mother has been ordered by the court to pay back the sum of $1,2 million dollars before he can get his freedom back.","Jared Arnold, 28, was sold in 1993 to the owner of Circus Magicus, Todd Bentley, by his mother Tamara Lee Arnold. The contract specified at the time that M. Bentley took legal ownership of Jared until his 21st birthday, after which he would have to pay all expenses for which Circus Magicus had taken care of and thus would be set free from his contract. Jared Arnold’s lawyer claims that the plaintiff is using a loophole in an outdated 1865 Mississippi law which facilitated, anterior to 1995, the leasing, with an option to buy, of children from Negroid parents with economic or substance abuse problems. Jared Arnold first recalled the many jobs he had during his 20 years with the circus, of which he left five years ago at the age of 23. “I first dressed up as a midget, then I learned to juggle with fire and explosives before I burned myself and eventually became an acrobat. A back injury left me paralyzed when I fell from 30 feet high up in the air and these are the hospital bills I am still paying today,” he explained in court. A number of injuries led Jared’s adoptive father, Todd Bentley, to pay for over $585,769 in hospital fees over the past eight years. Judge Andrew Neil told Arnold that the contract was clear and legal according to Mississippi laws at the time and that “it was only fair” that he would pay back his hospital bills and living fees since M. Bentley was not his biological father and agreed, upon certain terms, to take full responsibility for the young infant at the time. Judge Neil also allowed the defendant to keep his job as a Starbucks barista, where he presently works, to pay off his debt towards Circus Magicus explaining that as long as he paid back his debt he could work “wherever he wanted.” Arnold’s lawyer pleaded the judge to reduce his client’s debt, claiming that at his current wage it would take the defendant over 28 years to pay back his debt but the demand was swiftly denied by the judge. Take it to the supreme court and stop playing with racist judge Was it even legal for his mother to sell her child into slavery in the 90s? He did not have a contract. He was too young to have a contract. His mother had a contract. Crazy. He’d did not ask for what happened to him as a child. Drop it and let the man live peacefully. Total insanity.

A team of South African geneticists has developed what they call a “genetic correction serum” that could allow black parents to have white children.,"Scientists of the Stellenbosch University’s Department of Genetics have announced a major discovery concerning human genetics: a biochemical solution that allows altering hereditary traits of people of African descent to allow them to have Caucasian children. The geneticists working under the direction of Professor Hans Engelbrecht claim that their Genetic Correction Serum (GCS) has shown a 97.8% efficiency during lab tests, with only minor side effects like nausea, hair loss, and erectile problems. According to Professor Engelbrecht, the serum should be approved by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority soon and could be available to the public within a year from now to help solve the country’s racial problem. The renowned geneticist claims this “miracle serum” could be the first of a series of new treatments designed to modify the hereditary genes transmitted by parents to their children. Over 800 couples of African descent have participated in clinical studies which showed a success rate of nearly 98%. The announcement of the discovery has generated a lot of reactions across the country and around the world. While some enthusiastically welcomed the news as a definitive solution to the world’s inequities and racial problems, others were shocked and outraged, denouncing a “eugenic approach to genetics” as well as alleged “genocidal intentions” behind the development serum. Several South African civil rights organizations have announced their intentions to do everything in their power to change the country’s laws in order to make the serum illegal in the country and ban further research in the domain.

A North Carolina man who had committed suicide by throwing himself under a semi-trailer truck has been miraculously brought back to life after 21 days following an experimental treatment.,"James Willow, 47, was declared dead after jumping off of Interstate 77 bridge in Charlotte and into heavy traffic where he was run over by a semi-trailer truck. Willow had recently lost his wife and four kids in a tragic car accident last October and planned to end his life when “the pain of living became unbearable,” he wrote in his suicide letter. Luckily for him, paramedics were able to retrieve the man’s body from under the 60,000-pound truck and bring him to Charlotte County hospital where he was put into a comatic state and later died that evening. James Willow was put into the care of Dr. Otto Von Beurk at Charlotte County hospital who decided to treat the dead man with an experimental drug, Trinitroperhydrotriazine, that the FDA has not yet approved for medical use. Subcutaneous injection of Trinitroperhydrotriazine at the radial artery puncture site has been known to reanimate dead animals in clinical tests but never had the procedure been tested on a human being. “The FDA interdiction applies to living human beings, not to dead people. In this case, Mr. Willow had signed his donor card and his body was thus not his property anymore but that of the medical establishment,” Dr. Beurk told reporters regarding the unusual treatment. Although Willow has undergone massive reconstructive surgery and suffers from heavy cognitive and motor skill losses, he is apparently happy to have been given a second chance at life. “I feel like God has given me a second chance. Maybe I can patch up my life together again and maybe start dating and meet someone new and even start a new family” he told reporters in tears, visibly emotional. Although James Willow does not know how he will repay the $1,8 million worth of medical bills his treatment and surgery have cost him, he believes that with a “positive state of mind” no obstacle is too great to overcome. Those are R&D expenses. They were not used to save his life, even though it appears to have ended up that way. If anything, they will owe him a percentage of any profit to be made off of experiments done on him as compensation. Just saying he should get something if they intend to make money off of him. Dude kills himself, they revive him and charge him 1.8 million to pay for something he didnt want.. I would jump for the second time. Well, he shouldn’t have to pay for the medical if it was someone else’s experiment? Right!? Should he be responsible for that? It seems like he has a second lease on life just to be under a mountain of medical debt? That should be pardoned. ALL OF IT!

"Madrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.","This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January. The young man’s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death. Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate. The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital. The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before he died. The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola. They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos’ white blood cell from saving his life. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans. The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat. A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies. However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing. The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos’ death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed. The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials. The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will  . There is no reason they should be altering our food. The people that put the seafood gene in the tomatoes needs to be charged with murder. This is disgusting. And sad that someone has lost their life because some POS’s are altering our food.

,"The 38-year-old zoo keeper was filmed in full action by a series of hidden cameras put in place by the zoo’s security officials after doubts emerged about the man’s devious actions towards the zoo animals. “Some animals seemed sexually aroused when it was time to feed them” explains Akhiroel Yahya, employee of the zoo for 14 years. “But what made us most suspicious was when we discovered Marylin, our oldest orangutan, was pregnant. She has never been in contact with any other orangutans because of her aggressive nature, so it didn’t make any sense” he acknowledges, visibly troubled by the news. The Surabaya zoo authorities became highly suspicious when Marylin, the zoo’s eldest female orangutan, was found pregnant three months ago The zoo officials admit it took them sometime before being able to explain what had actually happened. “At first, we clearly did not comprehend what had happened,” admits the zoo’s director, Abdoel Hakim. “Marilyn has been secluded for the past 10 years, it was a total mystery,” he acknowledges. “It is only when we placed several hidden cameras that we learned the horrible truth” he admits, visibly angered by the whole situation. When confronted by local authorities, the offender denied any wrong doing on his part. “He said everything he had done was consensual,” explains police chief Abubakar Jaar. “He said he loved each and everyone of the animals and was very sorry he had impregnated the orangutan,” he told local reporters. “He says he did not know orangutans could get pregnant from humans,” he added. If many experts believe the man could not have impregnated the female orangutan, some specialists claim a rare genetic predisposition could explain the unexplainable. Paleobiologist Bachtiar Pado Panghulu of the University of Jakarta claims orangutan DNA is extremely close to human DNA “Contrary to popular belief, the orangutan species is much closer to the human species than chimpanzees. We share practically the same DNA code, with only minute differences, which could explain the orangutan falling pregnant from this man” explains Paleobiologist Bachtiar Pado Panghulu, of the University of Jakarta. “Particularly in Indonesia, the genetic profile of some of the population is extremely close to the orangutan species, leading us to believe they’re might have been a common ancestor to both species only a few hundred thousand years ago,” he admits.

A Pakistani judge has sentenced a man to be executed after he was expelled 17 times from 6 different mosques for excessive farting during the period of the Ramadan reports the Islamabad Herald this week.,"The Ramadan is the most important religious festival for Muslims and the judge declared that he had indisposed people of the faith and even caused 53 people at one time to leave the mosque during a prayer, a “blasphemous act” which should be punished “according to Allah’s will.” The judge was lenient, have admitted many experts in the region, as he gave the convicted man the choice of being beheaded or stoned to death. Deputy District Public Prosecutor (DDPP) Syed Anees Shah told reporters the accused got a “very light sentence” for the crime of blasphemy. Muhammad Al-Wahabi, 33, suffers from chronic flatulence, “a rare medical condition” he argued in his self-defense, as no lawyer would take his case. “No lawyer is crazy enough to bet his career on this issue. If his client his condemned, as in this case, the lawyer would face prosecution and possibly the same faith as his client” admits legal expert Andrew Jones, a Middle Eastern law expert. Al-Wahabi did not contest the judgment and even said the judgment was fair and that he hoped Allah would be gracious enough to pardon his blasphemous actions. Al-Wahabi also admitted that he put a tampon in his rectum several times in a desperate attempt to mask the noise and odor. “A disgraceful and insidious act” the judge declared, visibly disgusted. “As a judge, I must set an example for other Muslims.  This is clearly unacceptable under Shariah law,” he concluded. Al-Wahabi admitted to the judge he had failed his God, his religion, and his people and was terribly sorry for what he had done, and asked for his two wives and seven children’s mercy in court and thanked the judge for his verdict. We just need to copy past August 6th, 1945 by sending the biggest Nuclear Fuck You right in the middle of these Muslim Religious Goat-Fuckers so they can freely get laid with fucking Allah’s promised Islamic 72 Prostitutes in the narrowed core of fucking hell.

Pope Francis pleaded the scientific community to halt operations on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) this morning in an official Vatican release as scientists at the Large Hadron Collider next week are hoping to experiment with a possible connection with a parallel universe outside of our own.,"The Pope’s criticism comes days after scientists at the CERN centre in Geneva, Switzerland, revealed this week plans to fire up the LHC ‘atom smasher’ to its highest energy levels ever in a bid to detect – or even create – miniature black holes and possibly “create an opening in the space-time fabric”. Another skeptic of the project is none other than respected physicist Stephen Hawking who has recently warned the end of the world could be sparked by the elusive ‘God particle’. Pope Francis warned the scientific community of “testing God’s limits” after the announcement of the reopening of the LHC, which has been undergoing massive repairs and been shut down for the past two years The Pope appeared visibly distraught as he addressed the crowd of tens of thousands of followers present at St-Peter’s square for the occasion for one of his longest speeches to date. “My fellow Christians, we are living in desperate times,” he told the crowd. “Are these the days of darkness spoken of in the Bible? Are the hordes of demons lurking in the fiery pits of Hell about to be thrust upon the world? These are questions we must ponder before allowing scientists to proceed to such experiments” he concluded. Last October, over 400 top physicists signed a petition warning that the Higgs potential might become unstable at energies above 100bn giga-electron-volts (GeV) and asking governments to keep experiments under these levels. You won’t know until you’re separated from God,then you can comment on HELL. Are you screening the comments? test I know hell exists dont ask me how We know there is Hell because Jesus said so.

Al Bahah | A Saudi Arabian man has been amputated of his left hand because of his obsessive habit of masturbating during the sacred religious period of Ramadan.,"The man caused a commotion last week as he exhibited his genitals while masturbating during prayer time in a large mosque of the Al Bahah area, creating a wave of panic amongst fellow worshippers who exited the mosque in great numbers reports the Riyad Herald. The man’s family that claims that he is sick and possessed by an evil   (spirit) also said he had no control over his left hand and masturbated often, even while reading the Quran, during prayer time and at the mosque. “We were also ordered to kill most of our goats because he had   (improper) relations with them. My son’s disease has brought shame and poverty to our family,” she added in tears. Amputation is usually reserved for thieves according to Sharia law but in this case, the judge decided that amputation could be of help to the man’s “obscene conduct.” Judge Muhammad Al-Wahari’s decision to amputate was received as a merciful one for the severity of the crime. “Although the disruptive nature and the obscenity of the crime should be harshly punished, I will be tolerant in my judgment and only condemn the accused to be amputated of his left hand,” judge Al-Wahari said in court. The judge also advised 600 lashes for incommoding the members of the mosque and highly suggested consulting an exorcist to treat the young man’s “indecent and obscene behavior”.

Toronto police have opened an official investigation after the administrators of a Canadian sperm bank have accused a former employee of replacing hundreds of sperm donors’ specimens with his own.,"Robert Casgrain, 58, who has worked as a janitor at the Toronto-based fertility clinic since 1996, is suspected by administrators of switching hundreds of semen specimens with his own sperm over a 20 year period. Administrators claim in the official police report that they estimate Casgrain could potentially be the father to over 22,000 children over a period stretching two decades. Although Robert Casgrain’s motives for replacing the sperm donors’ samples with his own are not clear at the moment, legal experts believe these revelations could unleash a potential class-action lawsuit against the former janitor. Detective Sergeant Rod Patterson of the Toronto Police Service warned that “even though the precise numbers are not known”, Robert Casgrain’s sperm “may have given birth to thousands of children over a 20 year period” he said during a press conference. Administrators at the fertility clinic were warned by employees of Casgrain’s erratic behavior and installed hidden cameras in the embryology laboratory last month before eventually contacting the police. According to one employee who witnessed the surveillance footage, Casgrain is seen emptying the vials of semen into a sink and filling one up with his own sperm while masturbating to pornographic material. Although it is impossible at the moment to know how many births resulted of Robert Casgrain’s manipulations at the embryology laboratory, DNA tests performed on clinical samples over the next year should authenticate which specimens are from Casgrain. Legal experts believe Casgrain could face a sentence as low as 18 months and up to three to five years in prison according to current Canadian laws. SPECIMINS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED…Janitors are always creepy…

A New Zealand man convicted of bestiality 37 times in the past 26 years was given the most severe criminal sentence in New Zealand since the death penalty was abolished in 1989.,"William Furphy, 63, a retired New Zealand farm worker has been arrested over 117 times for having sex in public with farm animals since 1993 but only convicted 37 times with no jail time. Judge Jane Seymour described Furphy as a repeat sexual offender who had no compassion for the harm he had inflicted upon his victims as well as no respect for New Zealand laws that sanction bestiality. William Furphy admitted himself in court that he never intended to stop and that all his sexual relations with the animals were consensual. William Furphy’s lawyer, Kevin Woo, also argued that his client’s practice was a productive one that enabled his client to generate more revenue as it made the animals’ meat more tender and their wool thicker, an argument that was dismissed by the judge as “utter and complete nonsense.” Furphy also pleaded that the animals enjoyed it and that he had sexual relationships with them because the animals “practically begged for it.” “My family has been herding sheep for generations. I understand their needs and so I give them what they want” he added, to a visibly annoyed judge. Judge Jane Seymour sentenced William Furphy to life with no parole and a minimum one-year sentence for every conviction he had been prosecuted for since 1993 for a grand total of 37 years, the most severe criminal sentence in New Zealand since the death penalty was abolished in 1989.

Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape. “I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me,” he told reporters, visibly ashamed. “Upon my arrival, they kept pinching my ass, rubbing my nipples across my shirt and whistling at me,” he said. A picture of Hermann Gottlieb upon his arrival in Syria in 2015, days before he was literally transformed into an ISIS sex slave. Hermann Gottlieb, 28, says he was drugged the first week upon his arrival and woke up chained to a bed where he would spend most of his eighteen months of captivity. “They forced me to dress up with wigs, lipstick, and makeup all the time. One of the commanders had a fetish for Marilyn Monroe and would even make me watch movies of her so I would talk like her,” he told reporters. “They kept feeding me and feeding me, one soldier told me they wanted my breast to get bigger by overfeeding me,” he recalled in tears. “One commander told me I was doing Allah’s work and that ISIS soldiers respected me and appreciated my services and that I was more valuable to them chained to this bed than in the line of fire,” he told reporters. “Once, I must’ve sucked at least twenty dicks and got sodomized by maybe 40 guys in the same day after a major ISIS victory,” he recalled in horror.

,"The young man that is being hospitalized at the Central Florida Regional Hospital is suffering from an advanced condition that doctors have determined to be  , an affliction that has seen a dramatic revival in southern states where 9 cases have already been diagnosed in Florida alone since last October,  Doctors interrogated family members after the disease had proliferated to the young man’s pubic area, an uncommon area of the body for the affliction to spread. Dr. James H. Potter, of the Central Florida Regional Hospital, says every reported case of leprosy this year involved people who were in direct contact with armadillos “At first glance, we tried to treat the affliction as an STD, but we soon realized our treatments were unsuccessful and the disease kept spreading more intensely until family members decided to tell us about the family animal” explains Dr. James H. Potter. “The family was afraid of legal consequences for the boy, but I’m glad they told us the entire story so that we can now treat him properly and prevent further spread of the disease” he added. The family members intervention might have saved the man’s life, believe experts. “Timothy always had a hard time interacting with others and making friends. He was always so keen about animals, so we decided to let him keep the animal after he had caught him last spring” admits Jane Whitestone, mother of the 22-year old man. “He was very fond of the little critter, he would spend all his time with him, even sleeping with him at night. We knew it was a bit awkward for a 22-year old to spend so much time with an armadillo, but he looked so happy, we never said a thing” she told local reporters.

A surgeon from the Houston Methodist West Hospital has been arrested by the FBI and charged with stealing testicles from dozens of patients while performing surgeries.,"41-year-old Doctor Jeremy Cornell has been working as a urologist for 13 years in different hospitals throughout Texas, settling in Houston in April 2018. After a three year investigation, the FBI was able to determine that the surgeon illegally harvested one testicle from each of his patients while he was performing delicate surgeries on men suffering from conditions relating to their bladder, urethra, or kidneys. According to FBI spokesman Thomas Perry, Dr. Cornell would dismiss the nurses and support staff or send them on red herring chase so he could be alone to harvest the organs. Mr. Perry says investigators believed the surgeon was selling the organs and were extremely surprised to find dozens of pickled testicles in glass jars when they searched his residence this morning. FBI spokesman Thomas Perry says investigators believe the surgeon could have amputated the testicles of more than 250 men over the last decade, Doctor Jeremy Cornell already faces a total of 137 criminal charges including aggravated assault and battery occasioning bodily harm, felony mayhem, possession of stolen property and improper disposition of human body parts. If found guilty on all charges, he already faces a total 0f 635 years in jail, and the FBI expects the number of charges to double over the next few days.

"Alice Springs | A team of archaeologists working for the Australian National University, who were proceeding to an excavation near the sandstone rock formation of Uluru, has unearthed the ruins of a large pre-colonial city dating back to more than 1500 years ago.","The important number of tombs and artifacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now. The site which was first noticed on satellite pictures taken in October 2013, using a newly developed ground-penetrating radar. The images revealed many 90° angles and various common geographic figures over a 16 km area, leading the team of scientists to direct some archaeological excavations on the spot, starting in May 2014. Over the last few months, many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace, a few temples, large rainwater reservoirs, workshops and dozens of houses. 287 individual tombs have already been discovered in a small necropolis located just outside the ancient city. The bodies are mostly of proto-aboriginal origins, but also surprisingly include a few Polynesian and Asian individuals. Professor Walter Reese, in charge of the site, claims that the extent of the site and the superposition of various layers of constructions, suggests that it was occupied for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century. He believes that the city could have held between 20000 and 30000 inhabitants, making it the most important center of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time. The various artifacts gathered from the site suggest that the city flourished thanks to some form of control over various gold mining operations in Southern Australia. The precious metal was purified and transformed by the hundreds of goldsmiths of the city before being traded for various other goods through an extensive network reaching as far as New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and even China and India. Thousands of artifacts have been recovered, including some 756 items made of gold. This bowl weighing 2.8 kilograms was found inside one of the temples. Professor Reese believes that the city could have been abandoned after some climatic changes in the 9th Century brought a dramatic decrease in the level of rainfall, making the city unsustainable.

Geneva | One of CERN’s top scientists has been arrested after “highly dangerous operations” were conducted under his authority at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider based in Geneva.,"Russian physicist Alexandreï Ziouganov has been accused of “breaking CERN security rules” by “attempting highly risky and dangerous maneuvers” after he urged technicians to push the giant 27 km long particle accelerator to its limits, avoiding potential warning signs given by his coworkers while intoxicated by alcohol and under heavy medication. The operation is believed to have caused an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on the Richter scale, comparable to the impact of a large lightning bolt, assess experts. Under the supervision of the physicist, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 7.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a record-breaking 13 TeV collision which is believed to have caused a 3.2 magnitude earthquake in the region The Russian physicist known for his bold character has been an outspoken CERN critic since he joined the team of international scientists nearly 5 years ago. “He is a man of extremes” explains his coworker, Romanian physicist Yuri Malania. “He is possibly one of the 100 most brilliant minds in the world, but his character is like that of an erupting volcano. He wants everything to go faster, he strongly believes we are decades backward in science. He wishes humanity would already be colonizing Mars and the Moon, he wishes to leave his mark and push the limits of science into the 21st century,” he adds. In a 2013 interview with Russian science magazine  , the physicist known for his   said that CERN scientists “were a bunch of wimps”, “incapable of understanding the importance of this technology” and that “they would never understand his genius”. The controversial physicist is also known for his obsession with dark matter and black holes. “His dream is clearly to recreate a black hole within the LHC” explains French science journalist, Jeanne Legrand. “He has always been a strong supporter within the European scientific community of increasing the capacities of the LHC and is at the origin of the highly controversial proposition of the LHCx, a process which would accelerate particles at speeds a thousand times faster, although most scientists do not approve of such tests for the moment,” she explains. Last year his controversial views and statements on the LHC provoked a wave of hysteria after   warned such tests could “have disastrous consequences for humanity” and could “open the gates of Hell”.

Krosno Odrzańskie| A pair of Polish fisherman made an amazing discovery when they opened the belly of the 410-pound catfish they had just caught in the Oder river.,"The stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones, as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World War. Alfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oder’s confluence with the Bóbr river on April 6, when they made an astonishing catch: a gigantic Wels catfish, measuring 12 feet (3.68 meters) and weighing 413 pounds (187.5 kg). Their celebration was rapidly transformed into interrogation, and then disgust, when they opened the animal’s belly. Among a large quantity of half-digested fish, they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany, as well dozens of human bone fragments. The two fishermen rapidly contacted the police, who opened an investigation to determine the origin of the remains. The insignia found in the fish’s belly, turned out to be a German SS hat eagle, dating back to Nazi Germany, that was usually worn on the front of the SS dress hat. The examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties, who died many decades ago. The biologists who examined the fish, for their part, confirmed that the enormous specimen was probably aged between 90 and 110 years old, making it one of the oldest catfish specimens ever found. Further analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s, and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer, killed during the occupation of Poland. The team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests, could not determine, however, if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animal. The stomach of the enormous catfish contained more than a dozen corroded bone fragments, mainly parts of a human neck and skull. The Wels catfish is a large fish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe. With a possible total length up to 4 m (13 ft) and a maximum weight of over 400 kg (880 lb), it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeon. Individuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons, ducks, rats, cats and even dogs, on land. Exceptionally large specimens have even been rumored to attack humans in rare instances, but this is the first time that human remains are actually found inside one of these fishes. A report in the Austrian newspaper   on 5 August 2009, mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, in Hungary, under water. The fish allegedly caught the man by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold. The man barely escaped with his life, from a fish which must have weighed over 100 kg (220 lb), according to the fisherman. GTFOH…💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 Your email address will not be published.

"Suez | Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.","The team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age. The scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor. They estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site. This magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a richly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman. Many clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus. First of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area. The sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted. This new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten. For centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical. “It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base. A lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.

Before she embarked on this highly controversial microwave diet, Jane was very skeptical about using a microwave to lose weight, but just a few days into the experiment rapidly shook her suspicions away. “I was of those loony people who think microwaves emit toxic radiation that gives you cancer” she admits. “I don’t know if that holds up scientifically but for the benefits it has given me, I’ll never stop eating from the microwave” she adds, visibly proud of her recent accomplishment. Surprisingly enough, the woman claims she can even eat fast food in her diet, “as long as it has gone through the microwave”, landing her a prestigious publicity deal with international fast food chain restaurant Wendy’s. U.S. Food And Drug Administration (FDA) attests that microwave cooking is safe and does not reduce the nutritional value of foods any more than conventional cooking. In fact, foods cooked in a microwave oven may keep more of their vitamins and minerals, because microwave ovens can cook more quickly and without adding water.

Rescuers were shocked to find only the husband alive and his two other wives dead, of which he had fed upon to survive during his ordeal. During his 13-day ordeal, Hamad told journalists that he decided he had no other choice but to feed upon his deceased wife who had perished during the car accident, but that his other wife vehemently refused to do so and died three days later. Hamad also said that he fears authorities will punish him for his actions but that he has put his faith in Allah’s hands and that he is ready to confront whatever judgment will befall upon him. Although it is not allowed to kill a human being under Islamic law with the specific intention of eating him, most Muslim scholars agree cannibalism is permitted, but only under special circumstances. “It is also not permitted to perform sexual acts upon the dead person’s body unless it is the body of an Infidel,” Ibn Al-Araby also commented in his fundamental writing  . Hamad is presently under intensive medical care as doctors fear his overweight condition and diabetes may have put an enormous strain on his heart and vital organs. Doctors were also surprised to learn that Hamad had lost absolutely no weight during his excruciating 13-day ordeal but had gained a healthy four pounds. These inbreeds use their mythical god to justify the most disgusting actions one can imagine. And the leaders of so many countries suck up to these sub humans like they are important … especially liberal women who are probably just tired of the effeminate beta males who are the only alleged men that can stand liberal women. What on earth i just read ! Oh God Jeez!!! The Wives should have ate him! There’s plenty to go around! Fat POS. Oh yeah, Allah is the answer to cannibalism. I’ll buy that. Not.

Kalimantan | An ecologist’s dream to watch orangutans in their natural habitat quickly turned into his worst nightmare after being savagely attacked and raped by a 400-pound orangutan in the jungle of Borneo.,"Zack O’Reilly, a young 26-year-old from Ireland, who is presently studying biology at Dublin City University and has been a Greenpeace activist for the past three years, had always dreamed of seeing orangutans in their natural habitat and was a strong advocate against the palm oil industry, which is a great threat to the endangered species. – Kelly O’Reilly, mother The young man was quickly brought back to a missionary hospital near Kalimantan where he lay unconscious for many hours and where doctors found traces of internal bleeding. Kelly O’Reilly, the victim’s mother, says she used to tease him, telling her son he looked like a orangutan, but she never suspected he would be sexually assaulted by one, she told reporters in tears Kekbek Mahlouiak, one of the tour guides present on the dramatic trip, says he has warned various tourists to be careful around the animals. “I specifically told him to wear a hat and hide his orange hair, that it could entice the orangutans. I’m not surprised of what has happened, I warned him many times. He did not listen,” he told local reporters. “It is very dangerous for people with orange hair, the males get very excited. A male followed us deep into the jungle many kilometers, he was very aggressive. There is nothing I could do,” he added. A spokeswoman for the Borneo Tourism Board said it is the first time an orangutan has physically assaulted a tourist on one of their jungle treks. “We are deeply horrified and saddened by the whole affair. We have offered the young victim a free tour if he ever wishes to come back again and will provide increased security for our travelers in the future,” she added. A similar incident was previously reported in a Jakarta zoo in 2014, when a young red-haired woman was hospitalized after an orangutan broke out of its cage and tried to mate with the visitor, resulting in the death of the animal by zoo employees.

"Bangalore, India | A rather unusual wedding took place this morning in the third most populated city in India, as a Hindu man married a female rat which he claims is a reincarnation of his first wife.","41-year old Chidhatma Basu lost his wife in a car accident in January 2017. The father of four young children says he was completely devastated for months, until one day, he made an unusual encounter. Mr. Basu says he rapidly understood that the rodent was the reincarnation of his deceased wife. He claims the animal was immediately affectionate, and even looked at him the same way that his wife did. Mr. Basu consulted temple officials about the mysterious animal and was assured that the rat was, indeed, his reincarnated wife. The Hindu priest who performed the ceremony says that Mr. Basu is extremely lucky to have found his dead wife again in her new form. While Hindus believe that it is possible for a human being to be reincarnated in animal form, weddings between humans and animals are extremely rare. This unusual ceremony ended up being very controversial and caused a lot of reactions in India. Many Hindu commentators defended Mr. Basu’s religious rights and saluted his “good karma”, while others criticized the ceremony, saying it gave India a negative image as a “backward country filled with zoophiles”. Some American and European organizations implicated in the defense of animal rights have also condemned the wedding. In a tweet published a few hours after the ceremony, PETA called the ceremony “disgusting and barbaric” and called for Mr. Basu to be jailed. Despite these critics, the wedding was entirely legal under Indian law, so Mr. Basu and his new “wife” aren’t likely to be bothered. Let him produce more children with the rat.

A Missouri babysitter was arrested by the FBI this week after she tried to sell the three children under her care on the online auction site eBay.,"According to the FBI, 37-year-old Janet Miller was hired through an online agency to watch over three young children aged between 2 and 6 years old while their mother was working. Less than an hour after the mother left for work that morning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation received a report from the Missouri Department of Social Services about a disturbing auction on eBay. According to FBI spokesman, Jim McElroy, investigators were shocked by the nature and the wording of the ad. Fortunately, they were able to rapidly identify the origin of the auction thanks to the cooperation of eBay. FBI spokesman Jim McElroy described the crime as the most immoral and ill-conceived crime he had seen in his career. Miller was arrested less than two hours after listing the children online and rapidly confessed to her crime. Miller had definitely underestimated the interest her ad would get as her auction attracted a total of 1,600 bids in the 2 hours it was online and had already reached a price of $27,200. Janet Miller now faces a total of 31 criminal charges, including human trafficking, conspiracy to commit human trafficking, kidnapping and child endangerment. Her lawyer has demanded a psychiatric evaluation before the beginning of the procedures, claiming that her drug addiction and mental problems make her unfit to stand trial.

"Boston | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’Neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.","The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered. Doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital say that Father O’Neal is extremely lucky to be alive, while he is convinced that it is God who sent him back to tell the world who “she” really is. The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light. He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”. The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors. The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female. Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father O’Neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston. we cannot even known if female or male…God is a suprime being never be compare to human being… GALATIANS 4:26-But the Jerusalem that is above is free and she is our Mother.

A San Francisco homeless man who was arrested and later hospitalized was pronounced dead this week after contracting rabies reports the Frisco Chronicler.,"Bernard John Fellman, 56, was arrested last week and charged with public indecency and lewdness after partaking in sexual activities with a dog in a San Francisco public park. B.J. Fellman had previously been arrested by the San Francisco police on multiple occasions for urinating and defecating in public, although he was never formally charged and was exempted from paying any fines. San Francisco police officers were dispatched on the scene after a number of complaints were made. A medical examination showed traces of dog semen infected with the rabies virus in the mouth, face, and hair of B.J. Fellman, 56, which is also believed to have caused symptoms such as fever, internal bleeding, and seizures before his eventual death. Eye witness testimonies also indicate that the man had spread what appeared to be peanut butter on his genitals to lure the animal to him. “The man had no pants on and the dog was licking his genitals and then he grabbed the dog’s penis and shoved it into his mouth. It is an image I will be stuck with for the rest of my life,” one onlooker admitted, visibly horrified. A San Francisco police spokesman said that although similar occurrences are rare, it is important for the population to “avoid interactions with stray animals which carry a variety of diseases” and to “refrain from any sexual activity with them as well.” Did he deep throat?

“,"The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030. “The Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankind’s history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense,” he added. Recently appointed science and technology advisor to Donald Trump, Yale University professor David Gelernter, in an exclusive interview with Science Today this week, claimed the Apollo moon landings never happened. This is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book  the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earth’s magnetic field. “In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earth’s magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO,” he explained in his book. “Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation,” he wrote. The Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planet’s magnetic field. “The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they can’t get past the Van Allen Belts” he claims in his 2012 book. “If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened,” he concluded on the matter. Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web.  profiled Gelernter as one of the   in 2016, describing him as an “arch-genius.”   called him a computer science “rock star” and “one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.” Also not noted…the upper thermosphere is ~2000º C. At that temperature metal melts, plastic melts, electronics melt…yet…we see them hanging out in their little fancy polo shirts while dangling from wires to mimic no gravity…sad sad sad Amen to Arnold brenner. Could not have said it better! With the line of thinking of this President and his science advisor, let’s pray they don’t decide over a cup of tea some day to test if the nuclear codes actually work.

The couple had rented a room at a local motel for the week and were apparently seen together at the motel bar only hours before their arrest. Woody Creek police officer Ted Stevens said during a press conference that although the 1868 law may seem a bit harsh or outdated, his job as a law enforcement official “is to enforce the law, not to question it.” In 1868, the Territory of Colorado passed a law making it illegal for midgets to ‘have sex and or reproduce with each other or any other animal’ after the Colorado gold rush had attracted thousands of little people to work in the mines. A large number of residents at the time were alarmed that little people would eventually outnumber the local folks and feared an upcoming “midget uprising” pushing legislators at the time to pass the restrictive law. According to present Colorado laws, if found guilty the couple could face a Class 1 Misdemeanor for a genital exposure-related conviction punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment and up to $150,000 in fines.

He is known to have a severe alcohol problem but is usually able to get the job done, so his coworkers were still confident when they decided to let him manage the demolition of a 6-story apartment building. Unfortunately, Mr. Daughtry was unable to remain concentrated on the job at hand and had his employees set the explosive in the wrong building, leading to the demolition of an entirely occupied 36-apartment building. Fortunately, there was no one inside at the time, but the mistake has left dozens of families homeless and caused over $4.5 million in damage. Greenville Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Gary Walters commented the incident in a press conference a few hours after the arrest. Lieutenant Walters says the accused was so drunk at the time of his arrest that he vomited several times in the patrol car on the way to the station, before falling asleep. Marty Daughtry now faces a total of 98 criminal charges, including 79 charges of criminal neglect endangering the life of others, on for each of the destroyed building’s tenants. If found guilty on all charges, he could face a fine of $3,450,000 and a sentence of up to 425 years in prison. He is expected to appear in court in March for the beginning of his trial.

"SHARM EL SHEIKH, EGYPT | A Saudi prince lost 1.350 Billion Riyals ($359 Million) in six hours as well as five of his nine wives while playing poker at the casino.","Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is well-known around the world for both his drug and gambling habits, but his latest betting frenzy is quite exceptional even for him. Spending the week at the renowned Sinai Grand Casino, the Prince spent six hours at the “unlimited stakes” poker table and had an incredible losing streak. In one evening, he lost hundreds of millions of dollars and was even forced to give up five of his spouses to cover part of his debt. According to the director of the casino, Ali Shamoon, the prince pawned his wives in exchange for $25M in credit and left them there after he lost. Pawning or selling women is rather rare practice but it is still legal in several Middle Eastern countries. The high profile of these particular women appears to embarrass both the Sinai Grand Casino and the Egyptian government, however, and a diplomatic solution remains quite probable. It is still unclear what will happen to the Prince’s wives and if they will be able to return to Saudi Arabia, and most experts believe that other members of the Saudi Royal family could buy them back discretely over the next few weeks. If not, they will likely be sold at auction in a few months, probably in Yemen or Qatar. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said his government would do everything it could to facilitate the Saudi women’s return to their homeland, as soon as their husband’s debt will be paid. This isn’t the first time that Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud attracts attention for bad reasons. In 2015, the Saudi Arabian prince was accused of a having sexual relationship with a male aide, taking cocaine and threatening to kill women who refused his advances – as well as sexually assaulting a maid. A few days after the facts were revealed by the media, Los Angeles County prosecutors announced that they would not be filing charges against the prince and he was allowed to leave the country. This time, however, the prince is believed to have lost the vast majority of his fortune, so he may finally calm down and adopt a more conservative lifestyle. Inhuman behaviour of Al Saud Family Members Are Well Known to the World.ALMIGHTY Surely Will Inflict His Wrath Upon Them& Their Supporters. This is totally an inhuman act of this guy. Where are his proud parents. Women are highly respected human beings and are not an auctioneer items. Please have some fear of Allah SWT who is Almighty.

Will he now be banned from the US I hope. Why is he allowed more than 4 wives? Lock up the prince until he pays he debts. Don’t let him gamble if he runs out of money. Idiots.

"Berlin | A team of psychologists and medical doctors associated with the Technische Universität of Berlin, have announced this morning that they had proven by clinical experimentation, the existence of some form of life after death.","This astonishing announcement is based on the conclusions of a study using a new type of medically supervised near-death experiences, that allow patients to be clinically dead for almost 20 minutes before being brought back to life. This controversial process that was repeated on 944 volunteers over that last four years, necessitates a complex mixture of drugs including epinephrine and dimethyltryptamine, destined to allow the body to survive the state of clinical death and the reanimation process without damage. The extremely long duration of the experience was only recently made possible by the development of a new cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) machine called the AutoPulse. This type of equipment has already been used over the last few years to reanimate people who had been dead for somewhere between 40 minutes to an hour. Near-death experiences have been hypothesized in various medical journals in the past, as having the characteristics of hallucinations, but Dr Ackermann and his team, on the contrary, consider them as evidence for the existence of the afterlife and of a form of dualism between mind and body. The team of scientists led by Dr. Berthold Ackermann has monitored the operations and have compiled the testimonies of the subjects. Although there are some slight variations from one individual to another, all of the subjects have some memories of their period of clinical death. and a vast majority of them described some very similar sensations. The scientists say that they are well aware the many of their conclusions could shock a lot of people, like the fact that the religious beliefs of the various subjects seem to have held no incidence at all, on the sensations and experiences that they described at the end of the experiment. “I know our results could disturb the beliefs of many people,” says Mr Ackermann. “But in a way, we have just answered one of the greatest questions in the history of mankind, so I hope these people will be able to forgive us. Yes, there is life after death and it looks like this applies to everyone.” A clinically-dead person might not have breath or pulse, but if the brain is still functioning, then it will still be capable of thoughts and emotions. Whatever these participants experienced during “death” was experienced by the living, physical brain. If their brains were destroyed, that would make them truly dead… but that’s not an experiment you could do. I don’t think life after death is something we can prove yet. To do consistent spiritual practice on the Earth plane of existence according to the 6 basic laws of spiritual practice is like swimming against the tide in the current era. However, it is also a guaranteed way of advancing to higher subtle regions in our life after death. They all just trippin dmt wich is released while dying. look it up. you can take it and have a similar experience without dying 🙂 Your email address will not be published.

"A student from UCLA has just achieved the highest score in history on an IQ test designed by Mensa, and she claims her astonishing result is due to her daily ingestion of sperm.","26-year old Alicia Franklin, was already a member of the high IQ society Mensa, after scoring 154 in her qualification test in September 2015. The young woman searched for ways to improve her intelligence, and after taking a new test three weeks ago, it seems that she succeeded. She allegedly raised her IQ by more than 65 points in 13 months, after she began ingesting a daily dose of fresh sperm. Her new results show that her cognitive intelligence, her perception, and her memory have all greatly improved. According to her latest supervised test, her IQ is now evaluated at 220, making her smarter than Stephen Hawkins, Albert Einstein, and Leonardo Da Vinci, and placing her among the most intelligent people in human history. According to Ms. Franklin, she started to notice the beneficial effects less than two weeks after she started ingesting semen. The Chair of Mensa International, Bibiána Balanyi, says that Ms. Franklin could now be one of the three most intelligent people in history. According to experts, Ms. Franklin’s theory is, indeed, founded on scientific facts, and it is very plausible to believe that people ingesting sperm could develop better intellectual capacities. Semen contains over 200 proteins and several helpful vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, chlorine, citric acid, fructose, lactic acid, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vitamin B12, and zinc. It also contains mood-enhancing compounds such as cortisol, estrone, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, prolactin, melatonin, and serotonin. Many of these elements could help get a better sleep, feel less stress and be in a better mood, which are all factors which may help to perform better. Nice. Umm, is this from one man, or.. If she drank the tester’s sperm, maybe that explains the score. Your email address will not be published.

"A group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters has liberated a group of farms near the city of Al-Tabni in Syria Yesterday and claims to have freed more than 3,000 sheep and 700 goats that were used as sex slaves by the terrorist organization.","The Peshmerga General Command (PGC) has announced this morning that their fighters had liberated three villages previously controlled by ISIS during a ground assault supported by U.S. air strikes. In one of the villages, they found an “animal brothel” operated by the terrorist group, in which nearly 4000 sheep and goats were used as sex slaves. PCG Commander, Col. Hemin Hassan, described the horrible conditions in which the animals were detained and abused. According to some civilians who were forced to work in the brothel, some animals were forced to engage in sexual intercourse with more than 100 ISIS fighters per day. The animals will now be transported inside Kurdish controlled regions of Syria and be distributed among families of dead Peshmerga fighters. The Peshmerga General Command held a press conference just outside the village before inviting the media to visit the alleged brothel. This isn’t the first time that the Islamic State is linked to bestiality, but it is the first official and operational “animal brothel” linked to the organization to be liberated. Other suspected animal brothels were found in the liberated cities of Raqqa and Palmyra, but the animals had already been taken to other cities by the Islamists. Animal Rights organizations estimate that 80,000 to 150,000 animals are currently used as sex slaves in ISIS operated brothels. The vast majority of these animals are sheep and goats, but some cases involving cows and chickens have also been reported. I’m completely sheepless! What’s next………”Sheepless in Seattle”???

So before they thought of their mother as an appliance but now she equals goat. That would make the men be goats or junk. Or both. It must be fear for them to try to discount women’s importance.

A Texas teen has apparently miraculously been cured of homosexuality after undergoing an excruciating 18-month-long new experimental electroshock therapy.,"The new experimental electroshock therapy, which originates from China where the treatment takes place in public, government-run hospitals and in private clinics, is the first of its kind to be performed on the American soil. Doctors at the Dallas Baptist Hospital have allegedly seen major progress in the young man’s behavior, claiming that his “homosexual urges” have also undergone a dramatic drop. The Dallas Baptist Hospital which defines itself as “providing quality health services in a Christian environment to local communities for over 60 years” claims it has conclusively repressed homosexual tendencies in the brain of the 14-year-old patient. Dr. Erich von Eisenstein explained that the therapy can sometimes cause “important neurological disorders” but that these are “temporary” and can be explained by the high-frequency voltage applied to the brain tissue through the scalp of the patient. “Through induction, this new technology can transmit high-frequency voltage of up to 35 000 volts at a time during an extremely short period calculated in milliseconds, and which, if prolonged, would cause permanent brain damage or even death,” warned Dr. Eiseintein. The former leader of the People’s Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, was a fierce proponent of electroshock therapy treatment which he encouraged during China’s cultural revolution, a period during which homosexuality was declared a “mental illness” and a “capitalist disease.” Now if they could just find a cure for being a Democrat.

"A 22-year sex worker named Ivana Kamensky, claims she was one of the prostitutes who had sexual intercourse with Donald Trump in Moscow in 2011, adding that the American President had the smallest penis she had ever seen.","In an interview with the Moscow Daily Herald, the young woman described in great details the night that she allegedly spent in Mr. Trump’s hotel room five years ago. Ms. Kamensky claims she was hired by Donald Trump along with two of her friends to perform several degrading sex acts, like urinating on him and on each other. She said that she had been shocked by the incredibly small size of his penis, and remembers laughing about it with the other two girls. She described Mr.Trump’s genitals as being the size of a grape, barely one inch (2.5cm) long when fully erect. Ms. Kamensky says she was paid $10,000 for her night with Mr. Trump, which is more than the average Russian worker earns in a year. According to Ivana Kamensky, Donald Trump paid $30,000 for one night with her and two other prostitutes in July 2011 and asked them to perform many perverted sex acts. Ms. Kamensky’s claims seem to confirm the unverified allegations about Mr. Trump being caught on film with prostitutes in both Moscow and St Petersburg, causing a scandal already dubbed as the “Golden Shower Gate” by some media. The scandal finds its origin in a 35-page dossier compiled by a former MI6 agent, containing unverified allegations that Russian security officials have compromising material on Mr. Trump that could be used to blackmail him. According to the dossier, the Kremlin had been feeding Trump some compromising information on his opponents for years. It had also acquired compromising information on Trump himself that could be used as blackmail. There are allegations of “perverted” sex acts and also of frequent contact between Trump’s campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Mr. Trump angrily denied the claims made in the dossier during his first press conference as president-elect. He described the allegations as “fake news” and openly criticized the media who had covered the story. Considering Mr. Trump’s tendency to react personally to most critics on his Twitter account, it is quite probable that he will react to Ms. Kamensky’s claims over the next few days. So he’s liddle’ . Trump was a rotten landlord in New York forty years ago. His treatment of people is no surprise to us locals who know him. He hired thugs to harrass the rent stabilized tenants out of their apartments to turn it Condo. He’s a despicable rat.

Flower allegedly would seduce workers in the meat industry, have unprotected sex with them, and leave them a note in the morning telling them they had AIDS. Tim Cook, a San Francisco meat worker and victim of Janelle Flower, claims that even though he feared being diagnosed with HIV, he had no regrets of partaking in sexual intercourse with his assailant. All 37 current known victims have all undergone HIV testing and all results were found to be negative according to San Francisco police. “Janelle Flower was possibly misdiagnosed with HIV since she suffers from severe malnutrition which may have been interpreted by doctors as an immunodeficient response similar to HIV,” one San Francisco police spokesman added during the press conference. Californian law previously punished people who intentionally exposed or infected others with HIV by up to eight years in prison, but since 2017 legislation now lowers jail time to a maximum of six months.

Allan Seymour sold thousands of sheep to Syria to “satisfy ISIS soldiers sexual appetite” according to a joint CIA and MI6 report has admitted New Zealand’s Ministry of Defense According to political analyst and Middle Eastern expert Dave Wellsborough, the demand for livestock in the region is nothing new. “Islamic law permits to sleep with goats, sheep or other livestock as long as the animal is killed afterward, which explains the high numbers,” he adds. In a controversial interview last year, Dr. Zakir Naik – a noted Quranic scholar – explained why bestiality is permitted under certain conditions in Islam.

The radiographs of his abdomen revealed that he, indeed, had a large religious symbol stuck in his rectum. Doctor James Shephard, who treated Father O’Connor, says he was shocked when he saw the x-ray pictures. After an extremely delicate 8 hour surgery, doctors were finally able to manually extract the crucifix. Dr Shephard says this particular Rectal Foreign Body Removal (RFBR) surgery was one of the most complex intervention he’s performed in his career. According to Doctor Shephard, the crucifix’s shape made its extraction particularly complicated. Father Wendel O’Connor refused to answer any questions, saying only that he had “an accident in the shower” and the “there was nothing sexual” in his situation. The priest’s case comes with a particular context which has drawn a lot of media attention to it, but it’s actually common for people to get object stuck in their rear ends. Every year, an average of 5 687 Americans show up at the hospital with various objects stuck in their anal cavities. Some of these cases have drawn a lot of media attention over recent years. In October 2016, a mother of one from Wallasey in England, was rushed to the hospital to have a large vibrator taken out of her rectum. In 2015, a 27-year-old unemployed American man went to the hospital with lower abdominal discomfort following an injection of a liquid adhesive in his anal cavity, five hours earlier. Other objects reportedly found in people’s anal cavities include light bulbs, bottles, cell phones, various animals and even a Buzz Lightyear figurine.

"Kim Jong-un’s hairdresser who had reportedly gone missing days after he had cut the leader’s hair has now been found dead in his apartment, reports the Seoul Post this morning.","Pak Yong-Nam, 26, was found dead this week in his apartment after “stabbing himself 74 times and poisoning himself with cyanide” have confirmed Pyongyang authorities. If the death of the hairdresser was reported as a suicide by Pyongyang authorities, the news was received with skepticism by international media outlets. South Korean investigative reporter Lee Dae-Jung claims insider information led him to believe that Pyongyang uncovered a CIA plot in which Pak Yong-Nam was coerced to discredit Kim Jong-un by making his haircut “look ridiculous” to the world Experts believe that Kim Jong-un is the prime suspect behind the murder of his hairdresser, who gave him the famous haircut that has made him the “laughing stock of the world.” “Some reports from within North Korea claim that he believed his hairdresser had ties to the CIA who ordered the haircut to shame him publicly in front of the world as an attempt to destabilize the regime,” admits the expert in North Korean politics. Rumors of a secret homosexual relationship of the North Korean leader with his hairdresser could also explain the mysterious death have also claimed some media outlets. This would not be the first time Kim Jong-un coldly executes alleged traitors of the regime as his uncle was fed to dogs after a disagreement and his sister allegedly died accidentally while falling asleep with her head in a microwave last February. While he is crazy, from what I read the people in North Korea enjoy their lives. 
Everyone has a job, there is no crime, and they do not have homeless people living 
on the street. Kids are not afraid of getting shot on their way to school, and 
there is not a drug problem. They are self sustained, and seem to be doing fine.  Who are we to judge them – look at the mess we live in. Yet, America could do nothing to blow his ugly head off and end the griefs of the North Korean people. America has it own problems and if America did that then that will cause another war which no one can afford right now. He is a mad man . Your email address will not be published.

,"A veteran of four space flights aboard the shuttles Columbia, Discovery and Atlantis, M. Bolden has logged over 680 hours in space, and is the administrator of NASA since 2009. He shocked many  people during a conference in Houston on Saturday, by declaring that “it’s only a question of months, maybe years, before technologically advanced aliens invade our planet”. The stunning declaration clearly caused a major discomfort in the crowd, and Mr Bolden was rapidly accompanied off the stage by two other NASA employees. A NASA spokesman, Dwayne Brown, explained this morning that Mr Bolden was suffering from a severe depression, and would take time to recover before coming back to his position. This is not the first time that a leader of NASA evokes the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial life, but it is the fist time that a leader of the organization openly speaks of the possibility of an alien invasion. Many other members of NASA have publicly denounced Charles Bolden’s catastrophic prediction, saying it was only his personal opinion and not the official position the organization. The Deputy Administrator of NASA, Dava Newman, tried to reassure the population by saying that NASA did not have any information suggesting that extraterrestrial life forms are getting ready to invade our planet. Mr Bolden hasn’t spoken publicly since the event and has refused all demands for interviews. YAWN! NASA looks like Africa, that’s why they haven’t delivered anything for decades.

"A 640-lbs man and his 450-lbs wife had a rather unusual accident last night as the floor of their apartment collapsed during a particularly intense sexual intercourse, causing the couple to fall three stories lower.","Michael Davis and Theresa Walker from Liverpool were having sex in their bedroom on the third floor of an apartment building when the structure collapsed. The couple and their bed fell through three floors before bursting through a wall and ending up in a laundry room in the basement of the building. Emergency services were rapidly called on the site and they were able to extract the unlucky lovers from their uncomfortable position. Miraculously, the couple suffered only light injuries and no other residents of the building were injured as almost half of the 250-year old building collapsed. Tom Watson, another resident of the building, claims the accident was predictable and could have been avoided. Mr. Watson says the landlord was aware of the situation but did nothing to correct it. Indeed, the two apartments below the couple have been unoccupied for months, a fact that explains the absence of casualties. Tom Watson, who also resided in the building before the accident, says the collapse could have been avoided. The Liverpool City Police has opened an investigation and some forensic engineers have been called to the site to determine the exact cause of the collapse. Depending on the conclusions of the investigation, the landlord could possibly face criminal accusations of criminal negligence causing physical harm.

A Californian woman with breasts weighing more than 30-lbs each claims that her secret is drinking a pint of sperm per day.,"27-year old Jesabelle Monroe claims she has been drinking semen every day for the last ten years, and that her chest has never stopped growing, even after puberty. She is convinced that her unusual dietary supplement is responsible for her breast size. She says she has been collecting semen from several of her male friends, who have shown rather comprehensive and helpful. Jesabelle Monroe recommends her sperm drinking diet to all women who would like to have bigger breasts. Ms.Monroe says she is “almost satisfied” with her breast size and could abandon her diet in a year or two. Despite Ms. Monroe’s claims, no scientific evidence exists to prove that ingesting semen could increase a woman’s breast size. The biochemical content of semen suggests that ingesting may have several virtues, from anti-aging effects to stimulating intelligence. However, for ethical reasons, no large-scale research has ever been done on the subject. I must show this article to my gf by all means.

According to Ms. Garrison, flight attendants rapidly ran to the cockpit to warn the pilots, but the two ignored them and continued for several minutes before finally answering the door. Over 30 passengers filed complaints with United Airlines upon their arrival in Los Angeles and the company decided to act swiftly. In a brief press conference held in Chicago this morning, the airline has announced that it had launched an investigation on the event and that both Mr. Mcphee and Mr. Ceniza had been fired. United Airlines executive vice-president James Garreth claims the company will investigate the incident thoroughly and do everything it can to prevent such a thing from happening again. Over 300 incidents of sexual nature involving airplane pilots are reported every year in North America according to the FAA. A vast majority of these cases involve pilots engaging in sexual intercourse with flight attendants or passengers, and cases involving both pilot and co-pilot are extremely rare. In 2013, four employees of American Airlines had been fired after engaging in group sex with 17 passengers. I’m glad because those passengers life was in their hands. What a shame they need to consider others lives their job should have come first. There is a time for everything but this is more than disgusting. We will have to think if our piolots self control, mental health, weather as well as sabotage What else will we have to worry about.

Attorney Peter Phelps also claims his client has never fully recovered from his injuries and that he is unable to participate in the activities or pleasures of life that he formerly enjoyed. In 2012, a similar lawsuit was filed against hand dryer manufacturer Excel Dryer after a seventeen-year-old had gotten his penis stuck in a high school washroom hand dryer.

A teenage boy from Polk County in Missouri was transported to the hospital this afternoon after a sexual experience involving a kitchen blender went horribly wrong.,"16-year old Brian Johnson was apparently alone in his parents’ house and decided to engage in sexual intercourse with various objects around the residence. He admitted to having sex with a toaster, a vacuum cleaner, and an old video recorder, as well as a dozen other items. This strange sexual orgy could have continued for hours, but it was suddenly interrupted by a terrible accident. The young man had his genitals inside the electric blender and he accidentally hit one of the appliance’s button, activating it. He was instantly emasculated by the rotating blade and his genitals were reduced to shreds in a matter of seconds. The young man was severely bleeding and he barely managed to call 911 before he lost consciousness. Fortunately for him, paramedics arrived on the site in a matter of minutes and he was rapidly transported to the hospital. According to Jeremy Morane, one of the paramedics who transported the teenager, the quantity of blood on the scene was a testimony to the violence of the accident. Mr. Morane claims the young man lost more than five pints of blood and is extremely lucky to be alive. Fortunately for him, Brian Johnson was transported to the Citizens Memorial Hospital just in time, and doctors were able to stabilize him. The paramedics Jeremy Morane and Jason Norris probably saved the young man’s life with their rapid intervention. The governor’s office has announced that the two heroes will be nominated for the Missouri Medal of Honor for their actions. Mr. Johnson’s terrible emasculation may seem unusual, but accidents of sexual nature involving everyday items are actually pretty common in the United States. An average of 71 Americans dies every year while having sex with various inanimate objects and more than 4000 others have to be hospitalized. The items most commonly implicated are shower heads,  TV remote controls, toilet brushes and vacuum cleaners. Incidents involving blenders are rather rare, however, and the most recent occurred in 2007 when a 47-year man from Illinois died under similar circumstances.

"Six employees of a fertility clinic in the city of Lanzhou, in the Northwestern Chinese province of Gansu, received sentences ranging from 8  to 25 years in prison after they were found guilty of using pig semen to fertilize dozens of women.","Between June 2016 and March 2017, a total of 86 women who had paid 50,000 yuán ($7,700) to be inseminated with sperm from “candidates carefully selected from the Chinese elite” were instead fertilized with swine semen. Only 4 of these women actually got pregnant, and all of them miscarried before the end of their pregnancies. One of these aborted fetuses was so deformed a doctor who saw it demanded an autopsy, and it was revealed that the embryo was part human and part animal. A police investigation then led to the discovery of an unusual fraud involving the   and six of its employees. They discovered that the clinic was purchasing pig semen from farmers in a nearby village and using it to fertilize its customers. During the investigation of the clinic’s dozens of refrigerated containers, the scientific police discovered over 80 samples of pig semen. The animal semen was labeled was labeled as “platinum quality” and, surprisingly, sold at a higher price than “regular quality” human semen. Six employees of the clinic were arrested in March and all of them were found guilty yesterday by the Lanzhou state court. The director of the clinic, Mr. Wong Hu Chan, was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for his responsibility in the fraud. He admitted in his testimony that he had planned this unusual scheme in order to cope with the constant shortages of “high-quality semen”, which is hard to find in China. The clinic’s two doctors were respectively sentenced to 15 years and 20 in prison, while two of the nurses were sentenced to ten years and one to eight years. Four other employees of the clinic had first been suspected, but the investigation showed that they were not aware of the scheme. Mr. Wong Hu Chan, the director of the clinic, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the crimes. Fertility clinics are barely regulated in China and a handful of other disturbing incidents have occurred over the last few years. In 2011, a  fertility clinic in Shanghai was found guilty of diluting its semen with a mix of yak milk and bat guano, a mixture that is believed to improve fertility according to traditional Chinese medicine. In that particular case, four women had died from infections linked to the mixture and the doctor who had performed the interventions was sentenced to death.

"Drogheda | A team of archaeologists affiliated with the University College Dublin, have unearthed three skeletons from a previously unknown humanoid species of extremely small size in a wooded area of Eastern Ireland.","The specimens measuring between 47 and 61 centimeters are presumably from an entirely new species of humanoid, distinct from modern humans, which would have survived until the 12th or 13th century AD. The bones which were presumably partially unearthed by a recent rainfall, and were found by three local children who were playing in the area. The young boys immediately contacted the police, believing they had found the remains of murdered children. The medical examiner called on the site, rapidly understood that this was not a modern crime scene, but seemed instead to be an unusual archeological site. He contacted the University College Dublin to ask for help, and the institution sent Professor Edward James McInnes to analyze the discovery. The bodies of two females and one male were discovered with a small number of artifacts in what appeared to have been a small settlement, near the banks of the river Boyne. The team of archaeologists led by Professor McInnes has named the species  , which means either ‘  or ‘ This tiny axe blade was found near the body of the male individual. It is presumed to have been used as both a weapon and a tool. Various small stone Tools and weapons were found near the bodies, including an axe, two knives, a spear point and even two miniature sewing needles. These items suggest that the Homo Minisculus had only reached a technological level comparable to human hunters-gatherers from the Paleolithic period, as no pottery or metal items have been found on the site. Many bones from various small animals including squirrels, hares, moles, and hedgehogs were found near the settlement, many of which bore traces of cooking. The various dating analyses realized on the bones and artifacts have shown that they dated from somewhere between 1145 and 1230 AD, which means that the species would have coexisted with modern humans for more than 45000 years. This amazing discovery suggests that many tales and stories from the Middle Ages which were considered as fantastic by historians could indeed be based on real facts.  could have inspired stories of leprechauns, elves, and brownies that are common in European folklore. Professor McInnes and his team believe that   could have disappeared due to the destruction of its habitat by surrounding human communities. It remains unclear at the moment if Homo Minusculus evolved from Homo erectus, from Homo sapiens idaltu or even from Homo sapiens sapiens, but its morphological similarities with modern humans suggest that it evolved as a separate subspecies towards the end of the human lineage. The explanation for its small size also remains a mystery, but Professor McInnes believes it could be linked to the scarcity of resources during the most recent glacial period which extended the last years of the Pleistocene, from approximately 110,000 to 12,000 years ago. After the discovery of the   (that would have stood about 1.1 m in height) in 2003, on the island of Flores in Indonesia, a human subspecies which is believed to have gone extinct about 30000 years ago, this new find proves that many other hominin subspecies did indeed coexist with modern humans for thousands of years. Humans are such rude creatures…i do not understand why..i mean no offense to any of you but why must we be so cold towards eachothers opinions..aren’t they opinions for a reason? 45000 years coexisting without anyone knowing…so who says they are extinct ?!?…I never doubted the “little People”…:) Has anyone thought that perhaps these remains are Pictish in origin ?

"Veracruz | Mexican authorities believe an international drug smuggling operation is using whales to transit drugs across the US-Mexican border after they discovered no less than 223 pounds of cocaine inside the stomach of a washed up whale near the small fishing town of Anton Lizardo, about 14 miles south from the city of Veracruz.","The discovery of large bags of cocaine washed up on the shore completely baffled local authorities and led to an immediate autopsy of the large sea mammal estimated to weigh over 160 tons. The large shipment of cocaine, which is the largest quantity of cocaine to ever wash ashore in the region, has resulted in an international inquiry led by the Mexican government in cooperation with the US Drug Enforcement Agency to investigate into the matter. Officials proceeded to an autopsy of the whale after deflating the carcass, which was bloated with methane gas, and could have exploded, before extracting more than 200 pounds of cocaine from the whale’s stomach Specialists believe the smugglers lured the giant mammal with a dead giant squid as bait, as the bags of cocaine seemed to lay inside the digested remains of a squid. “Never have I had to deal with such a situation in my 23 year career” explains DEA officer Robert Grant. “Let’s hope they learn this as a lesson and don’t try this pathetic attempt again” he said, visibly furious. If the bulk value of the cocaine has been estimated at $2,455,000, however, if broken down and sold, the street value is over $9.6 million, estimate experts. The cocaine is linked to the Gulf Cartel by experts “The packages were all stamped with a dolphin logo, indicative of narcotics belonging to the Gulf Cartel” explains local police chief, Juan Roberto Gonzalez. “It is a tragedy that they are using animals to do their dirty business, we hope an international investigation can prevent such incidents from happening again” he told a local news crew. Last May, a similar shipment was found on the seashore of Galveston, Texas, where 66 pounds of cocaine were discovered by authorities. Maybe this is tied to our commander and chief’s drug smuggling business? Maybe this is tied to Trump’s drug smuggling business? There goes my cocaine diet! Response to above- Far as I know, and granted that knowledge is limited, most of the people running cartels are not the addicts you’re thinking of.

Lieutenant Esmeralda Molina, one of the officers who arrested him, says he was visibly high on drugs and appeared to be starving. Lt.

According to the police, Mr. Garrison admitted he had smoked a lot of cannabis with one of his friends during the evening. He says he was walking home and was extremely hungry when he came across the pet shop.

"The Hells Angels chapter of the province of Quebec has filed a lawsuit against the attorney general of Quebec, seeking more than $2 billion in potential loss of revenue that legalization of marijuana will cost the biker organization.","The illegal production and consumption of non-medical cannabis was worth about $400 million last year in the province of Quebec alone, according to a Statistics Canada analysis of the underground economy. “We estimate that Prime minister Justin Trudeau’s radical action of legalizing marijuana could cost my client’s organization a potential loss of $2 billion dollars in the next decade,” acknowledged Hells Angels’ lawyer, Brandon Tuggs. Prime minister Justin Trudeau’s nationwide legalization of marijuana on October 17 has enraged members of the Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels who believe legalization could destroy “hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs” “I’ve been selling weed since I’m 12 years old” admits Gino Ouellet, 56, a Hells Angels member for the past 36 years. “Do you think I’m going to want to go work at Walmart or McDonald’s at minimal wage? I don’t think so” he told reporters. “It’s not the job of the federal government to regulate illegal drugs, they should take care of their own business and leave that to us” he argues. Canada is the first country among developed nations to legalize marijuana.

Four other cases have been recorded in the U.S. alone over the last twenty years and over 20 others across the globe, but all other cases involve people living less than 7 years without knowledge of their condition. Mr. Wong’s case, therefore, stands out due to the age at which he learned about the existence of his twin. The unusual shape and location of his twin brother have also contributed to drawing a lot of attention and mockery on social media, making his story more public than most similar cases.

"A Christian children’s book about world religions is sparking controversy within the Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu community.","The author says the book, “Jesus and Only Jesus,” is meant to teach people about “the true path to God” and explains in metaphorical ways why children should avoid pagan religions to “find their salvation.” Now members of the various religious communities offended by the book are pushing to keep it out of their local schools and libraries. Depicting the prophet Mohammed as married to a camel and in sexually ambiguous positions with goats is “quite blasphemous to the Muslim community” which condones any visual depiction of the prophet of Islam, explained religious studies professor Benjamin Appleton at New York University. Author Ruth Ellen Cain is a Catholic Italian-American and her works have stirred emotion in the past. She said “Jesus and Only Jesus” is about Christian pride and not promoting devil worship. “It can be easy for Christian and non-Christian children alike to be misled by Buddha riding on a unicorn or swimming in rainbows,  or prophet Muhammad flying on his magic carpet but these are made up stories that simply never happened,” she added. The book has already been pulled from various libraries and banned by several school districts in the country but is currently awaiting a final decision from the US Department of Education.

"Nairobi | The Office of the Principal Register of the Nyanza Province, in Kenya, has finally released 11 exclusive documents concerning Barack Obama’s alleged birth and early childhood in the country. ","These official papers had been requested for years by the Tea Party Patriots, an American conservative organization, to no avail, but the Kenyan Supreme Court recently ordered authorities to release the documents, based on a law on “access to information. These files, if they turn out to be verifiable, could mean that Mr. Obama had no legal right to become the American president under the country’s law. The papers released today suggest that Barack Obama was actually born on March 7, 1960, in Lamu, Kenya, more than a year before his father moved to Hawaii, where he allegedly met his mother. This contradicts most of the documents presented by the presidential office over the last years, suggesting that either the American or the Kenyan papers are actually faked. The official version of Barack Obama’s birth presented by the White House in the past was that he was born on August 4, 1961, at the Kapi’olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (now called the Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women & Children) in Honolulu, Hawaii. His parents were Ann Dunham, from Wichita, Kansas, and Barack Obama, Sr., a Luo from Nyang’oma Kogelo in the Nyanza Province, in what was then the “Colony and Protectorate of Kenya”. Mr. Obama Senior was attending the University of Hawaii at the time, where he supposedly met Ms. Dunham. A Kenyan publication,   had reported in 2004 that Obama was “Kenyan-Born”, but the lack of proof presented had led the rest of the mediatic world to dismiss the article has fake or unfounded. Jim Geraghty of the conservative website   may have sparked further speculation on June 9, 2008, when he asked Obama to release his birth certificate. Geraghty wrote that doing so could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet. Such rumors were very numerous at the time, covering many topics. These included namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; that his mother had originally named him “Barry” rather than “Barack”; and that Barack Obama, Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack Obama was not a natural-born Citizen. Mr. Obama and the White House had given no answer whatsoever to that request, choosing to simply ignore the question, but had finally released some documents that were allegedly Mr. Obama’s birth certificate in two different forms. The release of these certificates had seemed to put an end to the rumors at the time, but it is to be expected that the “Kenyan documents” will fuel a whole new wave of rumors and conspiracy theories.

An Ohio woman has been sentenced to involuntary manslaughter after her spouse was found dead minutes after he had performed oral sex onto her.,"Annabelle Gaston, 28, was arrested last year after calling 911 when her husband, Irwin Gaston, 31, had a cardiac arrest while apparently being suffocated to death. Gaston told the 911 operator at the time that she was sitting on her husband’s face while he was giving her cunnilingus when she realized his skin had changed color. Annabelle Gaston’s lawyer, James Caan, says he hopes to appeal the 10 years and six-month sentence given by the judge for her “reckless conduct.” Franklin County District Court Judge Henry Miller sentenced Annabelle Gaston to 10 years and six months after he judged her sexual practices “extremely dangerous behavior” and a “completely reckless conduct” for a woman of her size. To prove this, the prosecutor showed documents attesting that paramedics took at least 12 minutes to release the head of Irwin Gaston from the inside of Annabelle Gaston’s genitals. “The time of death is estimated to be 17 minutes before the 911 call and 59 minutes after Irwin Gaston’s head was removed from the inside of the defendant’s genitals,” he said in court before delivering his sentence. Irwin Gaston was also hospitalized last year only weeks after the couple’s honeymoon after “large amounts of fecal matter” had entered his lungs “during oral-anal intercourse” according to a medical report presented in court.

"A 117-year old man from Texas was liberated from prison this morning after outliving a 99-year sentence, becoming the first prisoner to do so in the history of the United States.","Grandson of one the most famous horse thief in American history, Henry William Borne was arrested by the Texas Rangers in 1919 for being part of in an important horse-stealing ring. His father, Henry Borne Jr., was hanged in Fort Worth alongside one of their accomplices, Mark Thompson, on March 16, 1920. Borne, his father and seven other accomplices were accused of stealing over 7,000 horses and mules, including a lot of 1,735 horses destined to the American military effort in the first World War. The eight others were sentenced to death and hanged in 1920, while Borne, who was underage when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to 99 years in prison. Unexpectedly, the Amarillo native actually survived his sentence, which was spent in a total of 11 different detention centers. He was liberated this morning from the Central Unit Prison, in Sugar Land, after spending almost an entire century behind bars. Visibly emotional, Mr. Borne expressed his worries about adapting to life in the 21st Century. Despite his long incarceration, the 117-year old man also fears he could have difficulty adapting to a life without crime. Despite his fears, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice considers there is a “very low risk” that he will resume his life of crime. In fact, the number of horse theft has constantly dropped over the last century and the use of identification microchips over recent years has made such crimes much easier to solve. Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2011 theft of five horses. Another reason as to why the US is scum of this earth.. biggest shame I’ve heard to, lately. I think he should have been released long ago!! He looks amazing!! How in the hell can they even entertain the thought he would return to a life of stealing horses away 117 years old. Nonetheless, im happy he made it and is now free to enjoy a year or so if life left. 117!! What the heck did they feed this man , organic vegetables!!! Poor guy he should have been released. WE just picked my father up from California Department of Corrections where he went in at 22 for robbery, no injuries. He is 69 now. No money, no clothes, he has me his only child and my kids and grandkids. There are thousands of people buried in there, forgotten and doing life for petty crimes due to 3 strikes law.

Martin Sanders lost an incredible 225-lbs in six months thanks to his blood drinking diet. He began ingesting by ingesting small quantities of blood collected from his wife as part of a high-protein diet. After the promising results of the first week, he increased his blood collecting effort by asking his sisters, sisters-in-law, neighbors, and friends and was able to increase his consumption to 500 ml of blood per day. Mr. Sanders says that menstrual blood is exceptionally rich in iron and protein, making it an ideal ingredient for any weight loss diet. He claims that after the first week of his diet, he had already lost almost 40 pounds and had more energy than he had ever had before. The 38-year old man says he intends to fight the taboo that surrounds menstrual blood and help people accept it as a great weight-loss solution. Mr. Sanders’ unusual diet has generated a lot of reactions from health experts as well as on social media. Some nutritionists have confirmed that menstrual blood could theoretically be a good addition to a protein-rich diet, but warn about risks of possible bacteria. Professor Betty Williams whs teaches Health and Nutrition Sciences at UCLA believes that a diet based on menstrual blood represents a serious health hazard and should not be attempted by anyone. Several experts, however, have pointed out that human menstrual blood has basically the content as animal blood but is at higher risk of bacterial contamination. Most readers also seem grossed out by Mr. Sanders’ diet, denouncing as “ridiculous”, “sick” or “disgusting”. Not a white person issue you f’kin racist.

He is filing a $185,000 lawsuit against Mr. Watson and Chikorama. Mr. Reyes says his new boss not only forces him to wear a ridiculous mascot costume but as even put up signs encouraging customers to “force-feed the chicken”, leading to several unpleasant incidents.

"Huntsville, AL | An Alabama man is suing the state of Alabama over a 153-year-old document he claims entitles him to own several black individuals and their descendants.","Hank Wyatt, 53, is suing the state of Alabama claiming the will of his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, has been illegally nullified by current state judges. Hank Wyatt recently came into possession of a document dating from 1865 previously owned by his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, which claims he legally bought four “negro” prisoners from the state of Alabama. The 153-year-old document signed by the Governor of Alabama at the time, Thomas H. Watts, boldly states that William Hugh Patton is given ownership over the aforementioned prisoners as well as to all of their descendants. Hank Wyatt’s attorney, Robert Lindsay, claims his client is entitled to a financial compensation since the document’s authenticity has been proven and complies with current federal laws. The Thirteen amendment to the United States Constitution declared slavery and involuntary servitude illegal in 1865, except as a punishment for criminality. This loophole, according to modern historians, was used to control, suppress and decimate communities of color, through mass arrests and imprisonment after the Civil War where black men’s free labor was used to help rebuild a ravaged South. All I’m saying is grant this money he’s due and then those same names have their decendants waiting for their funds from slavery he wins and they win. OK, my great, great grandfather was a slave to his great, great, grandfather. so now what? I wish your salvage looking a** would try it. I will make you regret suing. Why do salvaged people like him think black people not gone f**k him up. Wake up dude, nobody’s going for it. This is not 1800’s.

Seeing a dark-faced individual enter a brand new Lincoln Navigator worth more than $75,000, the officers believed he was an African American man attempting to steal a vehicle. After he ignored three shouted warnings from the deputies, Mr. Morris was shot five times in the back, in both legs, and in the left arm. Many miners witnessed the incident, and all of them insist that the shooting was totally unprovoked and unjustified. Fortunately for the young miner, the officers immediately understood their mistake and he was rapidly transported at the Middlesboro ARH Hospital where his condition was stabilized. Mr. Morris’ coworkers seemed completely shocked by the incident, and many of them openly criticized the police intervention. Despite the critics, Bell County Sheriff Eddy Lange justified the actions of the deputies and insisted that they had certainly saved Mr. Morris’ life by rapidly calling the paramedics. The Sheriff’s Department confirmed that a loaded rifle was discovered in Mr. Morris’ vehicle after the incident. Sheriff Lange recognized that the deputies made a mistake, but insisted that their intervention was justified.

A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover-up.,"The cover-up allegedly destroyed evidence showing giant human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America. The pieces of evidence were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to “protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time” according to the court ruling. The allegations stemming from the   (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution. During the court case, new elements were brought to light as several Smithsonian whistleblowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology cannot admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churchward. A giant human femur uncovered in Ohio in 2011 by the American Association for Alternative Archeology, similar to the evidence presented in court A turning point of the court case was when a 1.3-meter long human femur bone was shown as evidence in court of the existence of such giant human bones. The evidence came as a blow to the Smithsonian’s lawyers as the bone had been stolen from the Smithsonian by one of their high-level curators in the mid-1930’s who had kept the bone all his life and which had admitted on his deathbed in writing of the undercover operations of the Smithsonian. The US Supreme Court has since forced the Smithsonian Institution to publicly release classified information about anything related to the “destruction of evidence pertaining to the mound builder culture” and to elements “relative to human skeletons of greater height than usual”, a ruling the AIAA is extremely enthused about. The documents are scheduled to be released in 2020 and the operation will be coordinated by an independent scientific organization to assure political neutrality. Wow this is huge.

“,"Astonishingly, the papyri were written by men who participated in the building of the Great Pyramid, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, and mention the use of “beastly creatures” of “enormous size” according to Professor Al-Sammud. The outlandish claim would have been rapidly dismissed if it did not come from one of Egyptology’s most eminent figures and has definitely come as a surprise to the scientific community. The Narmer Palette, also known as the Great Hierakonpolis Palette or the Palette of Narmer, is a significant Egyptian archeological find, dating from about the 31st century BC, containing some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found and also believed by some to depict living dinosaurs. Surprisingly, the discovery of the ancient papyri and 26 stone cosmetic palettes bearing carved decoration and hieroglyphic writings was made in a nearby cave only a few kilometers outside modern Cairo. The team of researchers believe that the caves had served as a kind of boat storage depot during the fourth dynasty of the Old Kingdom, about 4,600 years ago. “We unearthed entire rolls of papyrus, some a few feet long and still relatively intact, written in hieroglyphics as well as hieratic, the cursive script the ancient Egyptians used for everyday communication,” explains phD student Fatima Al-Faya. The papyri also mention “the noble Ankh-haf,” who was known to be the half-brother of the Pharaoh Khufu and is described as overseeing some of the construction of the Great Pyramid. The most surprising portions of the ancient texts and stone palettes are concerning Ra Nt-Ka, translated as “God beast” which was presumably tamed and used to carry the large limestone blocks that compose the pyramids. “For centuries it was presumed that Ra Nt-Ka was possibly a whale, but here we have descriptions of Ra Nt-Ka delving in water as well as on land, and the papyri mention that the animal “of great stature” was used to carry materials used during the construction of the pyramids,” explains Prof Al-Sammud, visibly exhilarated. “They are described as tamed beasts of burden who “eat of the Niles grass”, whose tail when lashed “can kill an army of men” and “whose necks reach out to the sky”, which lets us believe the creature could depict a species of brontosaurus of some kind” he adds. This incredible discovery occurs  decades after paleontologists have unearthed the first fossils of a colossal new species of dinosaur in Egypt, one of the heaviest creatures to have walked the Earth. Its name, Paralititan, means tidal giant. The long-necked, long-tailed vegetarian could have straddled a modern African elephant, say experts. “We can’t speculate if this is the species of dinosaur that may have lived amongst ancient Egyptians but fossil remains are fairly prevalent in the Nile region and these amphibious beasts were definitely common in the area at one time” explains fellow Egyptologist, Helmut Ferrlug of the University of Berlin. One recent skeleton finding in 2014 proved to be a new species of Titanosaurus, a group of long-necked, long-tailed, plant-eating dinosaurs that includes some of the largest animals ever. The period in which Paralititan lived is still a mystery to paleontologists. No no i built the pyramids Your email address will not be published.

Niagara Falls | Divers from,"The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities. Archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on the site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II. A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease. The divers of the U.S. Coastguard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation. The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast. Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.

He also explained that the food must be purchased locally for a cost of less than $40 and that any unorthodox or unavailable requests would be replaced with substitutes. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Dunlop’s request was declined and he was served two slices of a cheese pizza, a chocolate bar and a cup of black coffee from the prison’s canteen. Correctional officer Ramon Sanchez says he was totally shocked when he discussed with Mr. Dunlop about his last meal request. The ritual associated with the prisoners’ last meals is usually respected in most American states where the death penalty is practiced, except in Texas where an unusual case lead to it being abolished. In September 2011,  Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a huge last meal including a plate of two chicken-fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, a bowl of fried okra with ketchup, a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread, a portion of three fajitas, a meat lover’s pizza, a pint of Blue Bell ice cream, a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts, and a serving equivalent to three root beers. Mr. Brewer did not eat any of it, saying he was not hungry, a provocation which led the state of Texas to abolish all special last meal requests. Lol yeah right. Sanchez is phillipeano. We know he eats cats himself… This is so horrible. The privilege of eating big juicy pussy should not be given to men such as these. I hope he gets a big NO!

"New Delhi police have linked a series of gruesome murders to what locals are starting to call a “man-eating cow,” reports the Delhi Herald this morning.","Delhi police, who have recovered the remains of at least twenty-six people in the past three weeks, first believed they were facing an alleged serial killer, officials said yesterday. Reports from over two hundred eyewitnesses led the investigation to point towards a rogue “man-eating cow” which “eats the flesh of its victims” according to one testimony disclosed by a Delhi police spokesman. Ananda Vyanasmathattatanam, 33, was witness to such a deadly attack and made national headlines after his brother Purjat Vyanasmathattatanam was killed by the “man-eating cow” of Delhi last month. Family members tried to reanimate Purjat Vyanasmathattatanam, 28, in vain. “We tried to reanimate him but his lungs were full of cow shit” his brother, Ananda Vyanasmathattatanam, recalled in agony. Some followers of the Hindu faith strongly believe the “man-eating cow” is possibly a reincarnation of Kamadhenu, a highly venerated cow goddess in Hindu mythology. “Kamadhenu is taking vengeance upon the evil filthy Muslim cow killers. Kamadhenu’s vengeance is upon them,” one man told reporters. Delhi police have warned citizens not to take action against the animal as cows are considered sacred by India’s Hindu majority, and the slaughter of cows is punishable with life imprisonment in most states.

"Cincinnati, OH | A 15-year old girl from Ohio claims to be carrying the child of Jesus Christ, after being “divinely impregnated” during an encounter with an angel.","Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she was visited by an “Angel of God” in July 2017, who told her that she had been chosen to bear the Christ’s son. “He told me that he was a Nephilim, like those described in the Bible,” explained the young girl. Nephilims are indeed mythical creatures mentioned in the Genesis 6:4: “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.” This type of creature has been almost unheard of over the last few thousand years, so the teenager’s claim has surprised everyone in her family when she announced it to them. Being very religious themselves, they rapidly accepted her claim and showed flawless support for the 15-year old. The medical doctor who has been following her pregnancy, Dr. William Franklin Murphy, says he is aware of his patient’s version but is unable to either confirm or invalidate her claims. “For all I know, her pregnancy seems normal,” claims the Due to laws concerning medical secrets, Dr. Murphy refused to discuss any details concerning the young woman’s pregnancy but said it didn’t really have anything really unusual except her apparent virginity. The teenager’s claim has stirred quite a controversy that has reached far beyond her religious community. While most people have shown their support to Ms. Smith-Nabengana, others have launched various accusations on the social media, ranging from fabricating the whole story to sleeping with a demonic creature known as an incubus. Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she wants to demand a paternity test as soon as her son is born, to prove that she is telling the truth. In the meantime, her story will continue to generate a lot of debate and stir a lot of emotions across the United States. May God help you. It’s about time.

A dairy farmer from Southern Ireland says he was sexually assaulted for two days by “an extremely short bearded humanoid” which he says is a leprechaun.,"In an exclusive interview broadcasted this morning on RTÉ, Angus Brennan from Watergrasshill, near Cork, says he was milking his cows on Saturday when he was hit on the head from behind with a shovel or similar tool. The attack knocked him out, and when he woke up a few hours later, he had been tied up to a support beam inside his own barn. The 54-year old farmer says he was repeatedly raped over the next 40 hours by a “waist-high midget with a red beard and a cocked hat”. According to Mr. Brennan, the “leprechaun” raped him more than 20 times over the weekend before leaving for some unknown reason. Gardaí officers and paramedics arrived on the site within minutes and found Mr. Brennan lying in a pool of his own blood. He was transported to the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork where doctors observed “obvious signs of a violent sexual aggression”. Gardai Commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan confirmed that the national police force had opened an investigation, but insisted that investigators were, at the moment, looking for “human” suspects. According to the police, the suspect could be a bearded, red-headed midget measuring around 80 centimeters tall. It’s rather improbable that the rapist turns out to be a Leprechaun, a type of fairy in Irish folklore usually depicted as little bearded men who partake in mischief. Even so, a surprisingly high number of leprechaun sightings and even a few other attacks have reported over recent years across the United Kingdom, and even in the United States. In April 2015, a Welsh man reported being assaulted and robbed by a pair of “evil-looking leprechauns” armed with knives. In June 2012, in Seattle, a man who was found covered in blood outside a bar reported being assaulted by “a bunch of leprechauns”. In 2006, a leprechaun sighting in Mobile drew large crowds and even forced police intervention. In all cases, the leprechauns have yet to be apprehended. UFO entity.

Despite his condition, he had always lived a rather normal life until last week, when he decided to abandon his job and family to live naked in the forest. His wife Johanna says her husband’s decision was spontaneous and unexpected, even if he talked about being a squirrel for years. She also fears for his health since temperatures are extremely cold at this time of the year. Mr. Meyers’ wife and two children are afraid that he could get sick or die if he keeps living naked in the woods. The transspecies movement has gained in popularity in recent years and an increasing number of cases of people choosing to live as animals have attracted the attention of the media over recent years. According to experts, only a small portion of those, like Mr. Meyers, actually suffer from medical conditions explaining their lifestyle, while others choose to live this way.

Mr. Volchenkov claims he killed Mr. Trump after an event in Prague in 2006, insisting that the man acting as president is an impostor. He says he strangled the billionaire in his hotel room and that the FSB immediately replaced the billionaire with a look-alike. Vladimir Volchenkov claims he only saw Mr. Trump as a businessman at the time and had no idea that the Kremlin intended to get their agent elected President.

Anthony Willow, 85, who has been an atheist for the past 60 years of his life said he previously never believed in an afterlife, but since his out-of-body experience, he has gained a new perspective on life and treasures every moment. Apparently, Jeffrey Epstein’s “light spirit,” as Willow described, had somewhat the role of a tour guide for the “newly departed souls,” and reunited them with lost family members as well as answered their questions. “He’s a really great guy, nothing like the monster portrayed by the media. I guess he can’t be that bad if he has his place in Heaven,” Willow argued, in Epstein’s defense.

"Rochester, NY | A redhead teenage boy has launched a controversial lawsuit against his parents this morning, for not preventing his birth, even if they were aware the high probability of his hair being red.","13-year old Liam Murphy, filed a “Wrongful Life” lawsuit against his red-haired parents, alleging that they knew their children would very likely inherit this undesirable trait. He claims that they caused him a “voluntary prejudice” by giving life to him, knowing that he would be born into a life of pain and suffering. He is demanding the incredible amount of $1.35 million in “pain and suffering”, that is, monetary compensation for the entire experience of having a disabled life versus having a healthy mind and body, as well as $800 000 in “loss of enjoyment of life”. Liam Murphy’s lawyer, James Franklin O’Connor, told reporters that his client’s claim is “incredibly conservative considering the situation”, and says he is confident about the upcoming trial. The boy’s lawyer told reporters that he personally thought his client could have demanded “at least three times” more than is actual demand, but that the teenager had decided to “go easy” on his parents. A 2014 study from the University College Cork did show that redheads are “more likely to be bullied” than others and concluded that “bullying of gingers” is “one of the last socially accepted forms of prejudice against people for a trait they were born with”. The results showed 60.6% of males and 47.3% of females with red hair said that they had suffered “some kind of discrimination in the past due to their hair color”. Even the British royal Prince Harry admitted to CBS in 2014, that he has been regularly bullied over his ginger locks in the past, and has sought councilling about it. Liam’s parents, however, have a very different perspective on the question, saying that “God gave him red hair”, not them, and that he should “be happy to be alive”. Liam’ parents, Larry and Theresa Murphy, say they don’t understand why the oldest of their three children is suing them. They say that for them, red hair is a “God-given particularity”, not a handicap. In recent years, a few “Wrongful Life” lawsuits have generated financial compensations of up to $20 millions for some children, but these were for plaintiffs born with heavy disabilities or debilitating diseases. This is the first time that such a claim is filed concerning a physical trait, and could, therefore, become a legal precedent for future cases. Both parties should return to court on April 12 for the beginning of the trial, which is expected to attract a lot of attention from the media. The judge should pay him 3 dollars and send him to his mother’s job to get his hair dyed. Then beat his butt for the hassle and ground him till he’s 18. He needs to get over it. Or he could move to Ireland and fit right in. that kid is going to be grounded forever The lawyer should be disbarred for wasting the time of the court on a frivolous case.

"Juliet Manson, from Glendale in California, received a very special present from her mother for Christmas: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery.","The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years, insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery. Her mother, Dana Manson,  says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time, but her daughter was “completely obsessed” with the idea of getting breast implants. Ms. Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter, hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result, however, was very different from what she expected. After a dozen sessions with the young girl, the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem,  and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial. Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years, and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself. Following the psychiatrist’s advice, Ms. Manson contacted dozens of clinics in the United States and Mexico, but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl. She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China, where doctors were willing to perform the operation. Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present. They left for China on December 22, and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic, the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned. The young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”.

An employee at the Dinosaur National Monument is now being hospitalized after experts believe he may have contracted a sexually transmitted disease dating back to the Late Jurassic period.,"Adam Weinstein, 23, was hospitalized last week after suffering from symptoms usually associated with syphilis, such as loss of eyesight, coughing blood, and swollen genitals. Weinstein admittedly told his doctor that he had inserted his genitals inside a stegosaurus egg at his workplace because he was depressed and sexually frustrated since his girlfriend left him several weeks before the incident. Experts believe Mr. Weinstein’s sexual interaction with the stegosaurus eggs dating back to the Late Jurassic period could have revived a 150-million-year-old dormant bacteria similar to our modern syphilis. The employee’s warm semen might have triggered some form of biological reaction which brought the dinosaur-era bacteria out of its 150-million-year-long somnolence, one scientist explained. “Not all bacteria can come back to life after being dormant for millions of years. Syphilis bacteria can do so because they form spores, which are extremely hardy and can survive dormant for hundreds of thousands or millions of years,” paleobiologist Hans Mueller believes. In 2006, a team of Russian scientists revived an Anthrax bacterium that had been lying dormant in ice, beneath the surface of a glacier for 8-million-years and which led to the death of an estimated 200,000 reindeers and 230 nearby villagers.

"De Soto, MO | Two Missouri parents were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their three-month-old child cooked in the microwave.","After a night out at the movies, the young parents came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room. Moments later, they made the gruesome discovery when the mother saw something moving behind the microwave door. Police Officer Dwayne Johnson was the first on the scene and found a “very confused” and “incoherent” babysitter lying half-conscious in the family’s living room Anna Krutchiev, the 16-year-old babysitter, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became exceedingly hungry and eventually lost consciousness. “I just took a few tokes because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Johnson. The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears. The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling. “It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds. Some Greenpeace supporters have even celebrated the incident as a victory for the fight against whale hunting worldwide Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.

Officers of the Kenyan Customs Services Department have arrested a Chinese tourist attempting to board a flight for Shanghai after finding a total of 510 genital organs from wildlife animals in his suitcases.,"37-year-old Ming Zhang Wei was arrested this morning at the Jomo Kenyatta airport in Nairobi while carrying two suitcases full of animal penises. The genital organs come from a variety of animals: 309 from zebras, 46 from baboons, 31 from buffalos, 27 from giraffes, 14 from lions and even 21 from pink flamingos. A few penises were so badly preserved that their nature was impossible to identify. Kenya Police Commissioner, Mathew Iteere, commented the case this morning, saying that more arrests could take place over the few days. According to Commissioner Iteere, this criminal network could have smuggled over 50,000 organs over the last few years. According to Commissioner Itheere, this arrest could lead to the dismantlement of a criminal network responsible for smuggling over $350 millions of wildlife body parts. Organs from wildlife animals around the world tend to meet a high demand in China, where traditional medicine often uses them to cure several aches and diseases. Zebra penises, for example, are often dried, powdered and drank to cure impotency and increase the size of men’s genital organs. Several animals around the world have seen their populations decrease as the high demand as brought the prices up and transformed illegal hunting into an extremely lucrative business. Several animals like white and black rhinoceroses,  African elephants, Siberian tigers and even North American black bears and deer have been victims of poachers in recent years. Despite efforts to counter the phenomenon, most experts believe that poaching will probably increase by more than 200% over the next ten years, especially in Africa. 中国魔人！ … … 要切咗佢嗰條!

The policemen rapidly found themselves in a perilous situation, being inferior to their attackers in both numbers and firepower. Fortunately for them, 79-year old Wendy Robinson was watching the events from her kitchen window and decided to intervene. The elderly woman equipped herself with her personal bulletproof vest and an AK-47 assault rifle, and ran to the officers’ rescue, firing more than 160 rounds in the direction of the assailants, injuring two of them. Two of the assailants were injured and were arrested on the site. They were transported to the Martin Luther King community hospital. Their state is considered serious, but doctors don’t fear for their lives. Officers Cordova and Cho say they owe their lives to the rapid intervention of Ms. Robinson and have decided to recommend her for the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom. The LAPD fears the elderly woman could now face some form of retaliation from the criminals, for helping the police and humiliating them, but the threat doesn’t seem to bother Ms. Robinson at all. The sector of the Watts neighborhood in which Ms. Robinson lives is known to be dominated by a primarily African-American gang known as the Crips. They are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States, with an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members, and have been involved in murders, robberies and drug dealing, among other crimes.

An Ohio man who was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol last night found a rather original way to beat the breathalyzer: he swallowed it!,"According to the Cleveland Police Department, 44-year George Murphy was controlled by patrollers around midnight while he was driving his 2009 Ford Explorer. The officers reported he had been driving erratically and suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol. During a press conference this morning, Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams described the unusual scene that took place when Mr Murphy was asked to use the breathalyzer. According to Chief Williams, the 44-year old electrician ate the device on purpose to avoid being accused of DUI. Unfortunately for him, Mr Murphy’s plan didn’t go quite as planned and he was immediately arrested. A blood test was finally done at the police station and revealed he had a blood alcohol content of 0.46%, more than five times the allowed limit. The Cleveland police chief warned that eating or destroying a breathalyzer is a crime in the United States and shouldn’t be attempted. George Murphy now faces a total of nine criminal charges, including driving under the influence of alcohol, refusal to take a preliminary breath test and hindering police officers in the execution of their duties. The 44-year old has already been convicted twice for DUI in 2004 and 2013 and had only recently recovered the right to drive. If found guilty on all charges, he could spend up to five years in jail and have his driver’s license revoked for ten years. Your email address will not be published.

Cockburn admitted participating in the orgy willfully but now seeks to determine who is the father of the child-to-be. The young woman told the judge she had since reflected upon her actions and has greatly matured from the experience. A “lucky” member of the Ohio State Buckeyes football team could be the unexpected father of the child conceived during a late-night party which turned into an orgy several weeks ago. Judge Martin Andrews has ordered that several members of the Ohio State Buckeyes football college team pass paternity tests after Jessica H. Cockburn, 19, allegedly had sex with at least thirteen of them. Cockburn’s lawyer made a list of thirteen names with pictures of the players of the college football team found on the team’s internet website and that his client specifically remembered having sexual intercourse with that night. Judge Andrews said that even though the mother-to-be’s judgment had “failed her that night” and that her actions were “extremely irresponsible,” that her future child did have the right to know the identity of his biological father and agreed to order the paternity tests. An Ohio State Buckeyes spokesman would not comment upon the allegations and said the university did not regulate the players’ activities outside of official games and practice time.

Derby | Archaeologists excavating on the site of some recently discovered ruins on the northern coast of Western Australia may have just made the greatest find in the history of the country: the remains an 11th century Viking settlement.,"The scientists, associated with the Department of Archaeology of the University of Sydney, were called to the site after some locals discovered what looked like the foundation of an ancient building in July, near Derby. The archaeologists, directed by Professor Allison Fletcher, were expecting a site from the early colonial period, but they rapidly realized that they were dealing with something completely different. They have unearthed the foundations of three larger buildings which were identified as houses, and two smaller workshops identified as a carpentry, which was also used as a boat repair area, and a smithy, containing a forge and iron slag. The type of construction and the items found on the site are very similar to the various Viking colonies discovered in Greenland and Iceland. The scientists have also unearthed a total of sixteen tombs, including these warriors who were buried with their weapons and treasure. The archaeologists have discovered a large quantity and variety of artifacts on the site, including a few weapons and blacksmithing tools, some bronze and silver jewelry, four ivory combs, a few stone oil lamps, a dozen iron rivets and a bone knitting needle. While most of the items seem to be of Norse origin, a few of the items suggest that the inhabitants of the site were either conducting piracy in the region or they were part of an extended maritime trade network. Two broken pieces of porcelain, a bronze vessel and a jade ring from China were found in the tomb of one of the women, and some semi-precious stones from India and Sri Lanka were found in the tomb of one of the warriors. This proves that the Vikings had some form of contacts with the Asian continent, but the nature of these contacts remains uncertain. This large bronze vessel, found in the tomb if a Norse woman of high status, was manufactured in Southeastern China in the 9th or 10th Century. Professor Fletcher believes that the Norsemen could have chosen this site for its natural harbor, the availability of eucalyptus wood and the region’s abundant iron ore. It’s a long distance from the site of any known Viking settlement, expedition or raid, however, and it remains unclear how the Norsemen actually reached Australia. The Vikings were a seafaring people who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of northern and central Europe, as well as Russia, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries. Using their advanced seafaring skills and their famous longships, they are known to have created colonies and trading posts throughout the North Atlantic islands, navigating as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. The Vikings are also known to have raided North Africa and some Mediterranean islands, but this is the first time that any trace of their presence is found in the Indian Ocean.

The felines’ attack was so sudden and violent, that five of the ten men were killed, three severely injured and two were only lightly injured, while the animals were mostly unhurt. The survivors abandoned their dead comrades on the site and hurried back to a nearby village for medical care, where they were rapidly arrested.

Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible. Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it. It took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr. Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover. Walter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”. Holman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”. Director Davis says the guards were surprised to see Mr. Morris ingest the Bible, but did not feel the need to intervene. In most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request. Restrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal. Despite its unusual nature, Mr. Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities.

,"Mr. Erdoğan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque “in the crater” where they landed. Erdoğan said. The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya Çelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi’s famous rocket flights, but it’s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635. President Erdoğan’s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims. Erdoğan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II’s conquest of Istanbul in 1453. The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them. The description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesn’t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate. The story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the “aviator” could have survived a flight into outer space. His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode “Crash and Burn”.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya Çelebi’s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period; The team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been “extremely difficult” for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight He has also claimed that Turks discovered America first so they own it.

Although the young man is still lying in critical condition, health officials do not worry for his life. “He has lost a lot of blood but it’s a good thing he got here on time,” explained his father to reporters. “I don’t know what the hell he was thinking screwing with that sea critter but with a little reconstructive surgery, the doctor said he’ll be as good as new,” his father said, visibly relieved. A San Diego Zoo spokesman told reporters that the “incident was tragic and deplorable” and that an investigation would take place to ensure that “similar incidents do not occur again.” I think that was a scene cut from the James Bond movie “Octopussy” Sick bastard got what he deserved Your email address will not be published.

"Newark, NJ | A woman that was expelled from a New Jersey McDonald’s for allegedly breastfeeding her 6-week-old puppy is suing the fast food restaurant chain for $1.1 million dollars.","Although the manager says she was expelled because McDonald’s has a no animal policy, Adele Albright, 32, claims the restaurant manager specifically expelled her because she was breastfeeding in public, an inalienable right in the state of New Jersey explained her lawyer, John O’Keefe. “Forty-nine states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location,” said her lawyer. “The law clearly specifies that a mother shall be entitled to breast feed in any location of a place of public accommodation, resort or amusement wherein the mother is otherwise permitted,” he told reporters. The manager of the McDonald’s says he was only applying normal McDonald policy and that no animals are allowed inside the restaurant except for the visually impaired Although Miss Albright says she covered herself and sat far away from other customers, owner Steve Owens claims many of his customers have complained and were indisposed by the scene. “One old lady passed out and had to leave in an ambulance,” said one eyewitness to reporters. Although animals are allowed inside all McDonald franchises according to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which allows the use of a service dog by a person with a disability inside any public space, New Jersey state law also allows women to breast feed in any public place as well and the judgment could create a legal precedent admit legal experts. Yall leave my mom alone she was just trying to feed my brother and yall are making this into something it shouldn’t be,yall should be ashamed of yourself Who cares? I think the lady should f* off, 1- she wasn’t breastfeeding because she didn’t give birth to that puppy and two that is 100% beastiality. Disgusting. She is sick in the head.

"Philadephia, PA | 44-year old Bruce Franklin was arrested this morning, after he confessed to killing his wife and eating her flesh while he was stuck with her in an elevator.","According to the Philadelphia Police Department, the partially devoured corpse of his wife was lying next to him when he was rescued after being stuck for three days in an elevator. Mr Franklin immediately confessed that he had reluctantly killed her and eaten almost 12 lbs of her flesh, saying it was necessary to his own survival. Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross, says the accused clearly felt guilty about his crime Commissioner Ross says the accused started crying as soon as he was freed from the elevator and kept repeating “Why did I do it?” Mr Franklin and his wife, Janet Willis, were coming back from the restaurant when they took an express elevator to reach their apartment on the 42nd floor. On their way up, the elevator unexpectedly stopped, and the couple was stranded. Mr Franklin says he hit the alarm and waited, but nothing happened. He investigated his surroundings, but there was no warning text and no elevator emergency phone in the 6-by-6 box. Since they didn’t have their cell phones with them, the couple had no way of reaching the outside world. Hours went by and no one came. Starting to get desperate, the 300-lb man tried to pry the door open, planning to climb down the elevator shaft like Bruce Willis in  . Instead, he was met with a solid concrete wall with the number 13 stenciled on it. Being in an express elevator, there was no opening for the floors that weren’t served, and Mr. Franklin found himself facing 34 floors of solid concrete shaft. The couple were stuck in an express elevator, and the shaft had no access to the lower floors. The couple could do nothing but stand there for the rest of the afternoon. And into the night. And then overnight. Then all day the next day. After about 48 hours, Mr Franklin says he was suffering from severe dehydration and began fearing for his life. According to his lawyer, Darrel Hunter, Bruce Franklin had no other choice than to kill his wife and ingest her flesh and blood if he wanted to survive. Mr Hunter says his client is in fact a victim and that Ms Willis’ death was caused by the negligence of the residential building’s security staff. Despite his lawyer’s claims, Mr Franklin now faces a total of 14 charges, including second degree murder and cannibalism. He could face up to 75 years in prison.

,"“At first, we thought these were modern grafitis” explains Abdul Al-Shalafi, the paleontologist recently named in charge of the site, “but the carbon dating analysis revealed that they were in fact, older than the rest of the drawings. It seems that these were probably the first images drawn in the cave, and they seem to relate to the earliest period of development of this settlement.” These amazing work of arts combined with dinosaur bones discovered on the spot, bring aa all new perspective to the theories concerning the disappearance of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. It now seems plausible that humans could actually have coexisted with these incredible creatures until a few hundred thousand years ago. “These prehistoric pictograms seem to illustrate dinosaurs being hunted by humans” adds Mr Al-Shalafi. “This could mean that humans are actually to blame for their extermination. This is certainly a revolutionnary new perspective and it will certainly be hard for many historians and archeologists to accept.” Dinosaurs are mentioned in the Bible. The oldest book of the Bible, Job, God tells Job to look at Behemoth. He even describes what the creature looks like, its habitat and what it eats. This is around 5,000 years ago. Mass graves of dinosaurs have recently been found and in positions that look like they died gasping for air. The way they are preserved indicates they died suddenly by a massive flood. Also, because the tissues are still in tact, showingbtraces of blood as well, it is proof that these dinosaurs could not have perished millions of years ago, as some scientists have said. The flood is also mentioned in the Bible. Your email address will not be published.

"San Diego, California | An American woman was arrested this morning in relation to an investigation led jointly by the FBI and the Mexican Federal Police about an incredible series of violent deaths in California and neighboring states.","The investigators suspect 39-year old Loretta Jones, who suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as well Chronic Hormone Disorder, of killing 189 people between 1993 and 2017, in both the United States and Mexico. According to the FBI spokesman, Bill Davidson, her medical condition makes her extremely dangerous to anyone who crosses her path. Mr. Davidson says the accused severely bit a federal agent while in detention and assaulted two others. Ms. Jones worked as a debt collector for a large financial company and traveled a lot, across California and bordering states as well as Northern Mexico. The investigators have so far been able to link her to 137 murders in the state of California, 16 in Oregon, 11 in Arizona, 8 in Nevada and 17 in Mexico. The FBI spokesman, Bill Davidson, claims she is probably the most dangerous individual he has ever met in his 24-year as a federal agent. Dr. Alonso Franco Gonzales of the Californian Institute for Mental Health as seen only one similar case in his career insists that this kind of disorder is extremely rare. He insists that Ms. Jones’ case has nothing to do with a regular premenstrual syndrome and is something completely different. According to Dr. Gonzales, there is little knowledge about such cases because they are very rare and because woman suffering from similar disorders are still burned as witches in many countries, even today. He believes that Ms. Jones cannot be held responsible for her actions because she is mentally unstable, but insists that she should remain in detention for the rest of her life in a psychiatric hospital. No charges have been filed yet against the Californian woman, but the FBI says it’s “ ” before she is officially accused. She’s stable enough to work in a large debt collection firm.

"Savannah, GA | A couple of tourists from Canada made a surprising discovery while scuba diving in Wassaw Sound, a small bay located on the shores of Georgia.","Jason Sutter and Christina Murray were admiring the marine life of the area when they stumbled upon a Mark 15 thermonuclear bomb that had been lost by the United States Air Force more than 50 years ago. The couple from London in Ontario, was on a two-week vacation in Georgia and Florida to practice their favorite hobby, scuba diving when they decided to dive near the shores of Tybee Island. While admiring the plants and fishes near the sea floor, they noticed a large cylindrical item partially covered by sand. They investigated the object and found out that it was actually a sort of bomb or missile, so they decided to contact the authorities. The couple is still shocked after their frightening discovery and say they will avoid diving for the rest of their trip. Rapidly understanding the gravity of the situation, the 911 operator contacted every possible emergency service, including the coast guard and the military, leading to the deployment of more than 20 ships and 1500 men in the area. Using the GPS coordinates given by the couple, they rapidly located the powerful 3.8 megaton bomb. An unmanned submarine was sent to determine the condition of the bomb before explosive experts were sent to disarm it. Fortunately, the thermonuclear weapon produced in 1955 seemed in sufficiently good shape for a team of Navy seals to try to defuse it. They successfully deactivated the warhead after hours of strenuous work, allowing the rest of the bomb to be moved. Navy explosive ordnance Disposal technicians spent nearly five hours working on the warhead before they were able to extract the detonator and the uranium core of the weapon, allowing the fuselage to be moved. The federal and state authorities were well-aware that a nuclear warhead had been lost in the area in the 1950’s and had never been recovered, but no efforts had been done for years to recover it. It was lost on the night of February 5, 1958, when a B-47 Stratojet bomber carrying the 7,600-pound hydrogen bomb on a  simulated combat mission off the coast of Georgia collided with an F-86 Saberjet fighter at 36,000 feet of altitude. The collision destroyed the fighter and severely damaged a wing of the bomber, leaving one of its engines partially dislodged. The bomber’s pilot, Maj. Howard Richardson was instructed by the Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. to jettison the H-bomb before attempting a landing. Richardson dropped the bomb into the shallow waters of Wassaw Sound, near the mouth of the Savannah River, where he believed the bomb would be swiftly recovered. The crew did not see an explosion when the bomb struck the sea and they managed to land the B-47 safely at the nearest base. For the following six weeks, the Air Force looked for the bomb without success. Underwater divers scoured the depths, troops tromped through nearby salt marshes, and a blimp hovered over the area attempting to spot a hole or crater in the beach or swamp. Researches were finally abandoned and the bomb remained hidden for more than 50 years until the unlucky couple stumbled upon it.

"Broken Hill | Australian authorities have captured a  feral young boy this morning, in the province of New South Wales, who had apparently been living in the wild with a group of kangaroos.","Many sightings of the boy had been reported by various ranchers of the region over the last months, and he had even drawn some attention from the local media. The child had been reported to accompany a mob of red kangaroos, which seemed to have adopted him as one of their own. Officers of the federal police were finally able to capture him this morning, 16 kilometers outside of Broken Hill. He was taken to the hospital immediately after his capture and was placed under the custody of agents from the Department of Child Protection. “We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy” explains  . The kangaroos accompanying the child were very aggressive towards the AFP officers when they approached the young boy. Many of them even attacked the policemen, forcing the officers to use tranquilizing darts. The young boy was allegedly traveling and living with a group of a dozen kangaroos in the western regions of the province of New South Wales. A few ranchers had reported seeing him around their property, scavenging various fallen fruits, seeds and nuts. Back in April, a man from Silverton even claimed to have seen him on his property, grazing fresh grasses and forbs with other kangaroos. “He seems to have spent most of his day, resting in the shade, coming out at night to gather food and find some water.” AFP Commander, Glen McEwen, admitted that he was very skeptical when he had received the first reports concerning a feral child near Broken Hill.  he told reporters. The boy is apparently aged between 4 and 6 years old, and seems surprisingly healthy considering the fact that he was living with animals. He suffers obvious signs of malnutrition, as well as severe sunburns, but he seems to have developed normally and to be in rather good shape. A complete medical examination will, however, be necessary to determine precisely his physical and mental condition. The boy doesn’t seem able to understand any human language and is visibly scared of other humans, suggesting he could have been living in the wild for many years. He is terribly scared of other human beings and tends to react violently when approached, so his rehabilitation is expected to be a long and difficult process. The Australian Federal Police launched an investigation to determine the identity of the child and the circumstances of his disappearance. They are asking anyone who could possess information which could be useful in the case, to contact the AFP as soon as possible. So many opinions, many that should be kept to ones self, but here’s mine. He defiantly looks aboriginal, so their may be no way to find the parents, or what the circumstances were. Yes, the kangaroos are his adopted family, and the little guy is sure a survivor, but I don’t think he should be left to survive in those harsh elements. I think they should find a tribe that will take him in and let them tend to his nourishment and care, rather then him being poked and prodded and studies. I agree!

An environmental activist was almost killed yesterday in the Indian Ocean after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off.,"21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth. Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting. The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals. Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him. It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital. Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water. Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood. Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive. Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures. Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling. Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark’s image as a peaceful marine creature. It seems Darwin was robbed.

An employee of the SeaWorld theme park in San Diego was arrested this morning for running a smuggling ring specialized in a very unusual product: penguin genitals.,"27-year old Thomas C. Frampton was arrested by the FBI as he arrived at work at the marine park this morning. The veterinarian, specialized in aquatic birds, is accused of “illegally collecting and trafficking animal organs” and is suspected of exporting over 12,500 bird penises to China over the last 2 years. According to investigators, he collected several of the organs himself from the animals under his care but also had contacts in others zoos and parks that were getting penises for him. A search of his residence led to the discovery of 84 penguin genitals, as well as 57 coming from other aquatic birds like ducks, swans, and kingfishers. In an interview with ABC, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the organs were kept in the accused’s home refrigerator. Investigators also seized two computers and several boxes of paper files, and they hope to find evidence to identify Mr. Frampton’s accomplices and customers. Ms. Eimille said that three of Mr. Frampton’s accomplices were also targeted by arrest warrants and should be arrested soon. Animal organ trafficking is an increasingly important preoccupation for American federal authorities, as some poachers and dishonest veterinarians make a lot of money by illegally supplying the Asian market for these traditional Chinese medicines. The Humane Society of the United States says that a penguin penis can cost more than $6,000 in Asia, where some people use it to treat erectile dysfunction. Some specimens which are rarer or more dangerous to collect can fetch even higher prices. In 2014, a dehydrated white rhinoceros penis was sold for $485,000 during an auction in Hong Kong. With such soaring prices, it isn’t surprising to see the increasing number of arrest related to this new criminal trend. I will give anyone a Buck Fifty for His Penis!!! at 1st he looks like a wimp.

"Washington, D.C. | A man from Virginia turned himself in at the FBI headquarters this morning, claiming that he was guilty of killing more than 30 people, including the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.","71-year-old Leroy Timothy Anderson, claims he worked for 35 years as a “time-traveling assassin” for a secret governmental agency and says he has killed people at various times, going from 1678 to 2239. The elderly man declared that his actions were all legitimate and ordered by the government, but that he fears his former employers might want to eliminate him because he knows too much. He claims that he was part a program called the Chronos Project, which was designed, coordinated, and executed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States special operations forces, under the supervision of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This ultra-secret program would have orchestrated more than 1200 assassinations, spreading out over almost all of human history, including many famous characters like Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Cesar or Mahatma Gandhi. “His story was clearly one of the most entertaining that I have ever heard,” said FBI director, Christopher A. Wray. “I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincoln’s murder and stuff like that, but the FBI isn’t going to open an investigation. I don’t think this man killed anyone, I think he just lost contact with reality.” According to the FBI, Mr. Anderson was previously diagnosed with dissociative disorder and schizophrenia, problems which could explain his strange confession. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending the play   at Ford’s Theatre, in Washington, D.C.  as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination is generally believed to have been planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause. Mr. Booth was shot and killed by Union soldiers while hiding on a farm in Virginia, only days after the crime. Eight other conspirators or suspects were tried and convicted, and four were hanged shortly thereafter. They need to investigate!!!

None of the victims were severely injured, but there is a slight risk that they may have contracted some disease from their aggressor. Ruth Davis and her colleagues say they see many strange and funny things at work, but this was one of the oddest they have ever seen. Michael Kruger told investigators that he spent the entire night smoking crystal meth and had decided to walk to the Walmart to get some food. He explained that he had taken off his clothes on the way to “get rid of the spying equipment the Vatican had planted” on him and was biting people to “make sure they’re not terminators” sent to kill him.

The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.” The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “ ” (“ “), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand for political asylum from the Helvetic state. Many sources also claim that Mr. Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.

Mr. McHenrry insists that his client’s demands are “more than reasonable” considering the gravity of the trauma he suffered. The defendant, Ms. Jenson Miller, admits that she “may have been overprotective” but claims that she “never had any intention to cause him any harm”. Mr. Miller’s mother refused to meet with the press to discuss the lawsuit and even ousted a Fox reporter who showed up at her door. This controversial lawsuit hasn’t even begun, but it’s already generating a lot of reactions on the various social media. While many people are showing some sympathy towards the 69-year old defendant, most of them note that her parental behavior seemed “rather disturbing”. Legal experts are divided in their analysis of the case. Most admit that the mother’s behavior as “clearly caused the victim some psychological and relational problems”, there is no sign of “intentional mistreatment” on her part. Both parties are expected the be back in court in December for the beginning of the hearings. What straight male would not enjoy breastfeeding? Pity his mother didn’t swallow him.

"Missanabie, Ontario |  A man from Michigan is in a critical condition after suffering a savage attack from a large moose, while hunting in Canada.","Jeremy Larsen was hunting with his brother and his nephew near Dog Lake, in Ontario, when he accidentally spilled an entire jar of moose urine on himself. He decided to leave the group and head back to their cabin, three miles away, to change his clothes. He had about a mile left to walk when he was attacked by a male moose, weighing around 1200 lbs. Mr. Larsen tried to use his weapon to defend himself, but he was rapidly knocked out after receiving many kicks from the moose’s front hooves. While the poor man was lying on his knees, defenseless, the powerful animal began rubbing his massive genitals all over him, mimicking sexual intercourse. The severely injured hunter was found two hours later by his brother and nephew, who were also heading back to their cabin. John Larsen, the victim’s nephew, says his uncle was unconscious and covered in blood when they found him. Jeremy Larsen was transported by helicopter to a Toronto hospital, where doctors were able to stabilize his condition. He suffers from five broken ribs, a perforated lung, and 15 bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life. Only hours after the attack, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry issued a warning concerning the use of moose urine. The ministry states that this is the third attack of this kind to occur in the province since 2011 and that all three were due to urine spills. It’s hard to feel sorry for a man who kills innocent animals for his pleasure. What a shame the moose didn’t finish this immoral coward off for good! What a sl*t, he was looking for this.

"Little Rock, AZ| A 16-year-old girl has presented a paternity action lawsuit this morning, before an Arkansas state court, alleging that the former president of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, is her biological father.","Alyssa Gilmore claims that her mother, a former secretary of the oval office named Whitney Gilmore, had an affair with President Clinton between 1998 and 2001. She says she was born out of that relationship and demands that Mr. Clinton undergoes a paternity test to prove that her story is true. Whitney Gilmore does indeed appear on many official pictures of Bill Clinton, like this one of an Independence Day party on July 4, 2000 where she appears with the President and his wife Hillary. Judge Henri Watkins of the Arkansas state court, rapidly decided that Ms. Gilmore had enough evidence to support her demand and announced that the presentation of the evidence will begin on March 19. Bill Clinton wasn’t present in the courthouse this morning, in Little Rock, but he met the media less than an hour after the judge’s decision, in Washington. Mr. Clinton denied having an affair with Ms. Gilmore or being the father of the teenage girl. He adds that the timing of the accusations suggests that they are intended to ruin his wife’s chances in the run for the presidential elections in November. Bill Clinton appeared extremely irritated, even angry, when he met the media this morning, in Washington. This is not the first time that Bill Clinton is involved in an adultery-related scandal. The most famous case is of course when he admitted to having had what he called an “inappropriate relationship” with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996. There were also many other women who claimed over the years that they had affairs with Mr. Clinton or that they were victims of sexual misbehavior on his part. These include Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddick,  Kathleen Willey,  Elizabeth Ward Gracen and Dolly Kyle Browning. Many political experts believe that no matter how this court case ends, this new story of adultery has reminded the population of the Clinton couple’s particular relationship and story. They think it could therefore certainly have a very negative impact on Hillary’s chances of being the presidential candidate of the Democratic party for the next presidential election. They already have WJC’s DNA from Monica’s blue dress. “… I want to get this over with as soon as possible.” 
That’s what she said A DNA test is the perfect GET OUT OF JAIL FREE card. It can prove conclusively that Clinton is NOT the father. So if he is that sure, take the test and be innocent until the day he dies… Your email address will not be published.

Canadian hunters shot an extremely surprising and disturbing prey yesterday while they were looking for wild turkeys near the banks of the Harricana River.,"Brian McAllister and Frank Morrison were spending the week near Amos, in the Canadian province of Quebec, to indulge in their favorite hobby. They were hiding in a cache waiting for their targets when they were suddenly attacked by gigantic flying insects. The two men claim that three giant insects, looking like dog-sized mosquitoes, stormed them and tried to kill them. According to Mr. Morrison, the largest of the three insects probably weighed more than 100 pounds. The two men fired on almost 20 occasions to defend themselves and managed to shoot down one of the creatures, which drove its congeners away. The picture of the two men with their strange hunting trophy quickly went viral on the internet and caught the attention of several scientists. Biologists from the University of Montreal were dispatched on site this morning to inspect the remains of this unique specimen. They concluded that the dead insect is indeed a mosquito, despite being considerably larger than most specimens of its kind. The monstrous creature weighs over 47 pounds and the two men who killed it claim that it was the smallest of their three aggressors. Biology professor and insect specialist, Bernard Morin, believes that an insect of this size could completely drain a deer of its blood in less than five minutes. The Canadian province of Quebec has been recognized worldwide for decades for the quantity and voracity of its mosquitoes. However, this is the first time that an insect of this size is killed in the region, the previous record being an 11-pound specimen that was killed in 2005. Some experts believe that this sudden and spectacular increase in the size of Canadian mosquitoes could be due to climate change. Your email address will not be published.

A Californian man who had been missing for over two weeks after a three-day planned hiking trip was found alive this week at the southwestern edge of  Yosemite National Park.,"Adam Lebrewsky, 27, was found by rescuers this week after he managed to travel 26 miles with a broken ankle and no food for 13 days. Lebrewsky who had injured himself during the hike had taken refuge in a cave where little did he know a mountain lion was already living with her cubs. Lebrewsky claims he was held captive by the mountain lion who refused to let him leave the cave but did not harm him in any fashion. Yosemite Park Ranger, Kathleen Heinz, believes that the reproductive instincts and sexual arousal of the mountain lion may have saved Adam Lebrewsky’s life. Lebrewsky claims that the female mountain lion forcibly rubbed its genitals onto him on numerous occasions and that he felt compelled to give her an orgasm, fearing for his life. “If I didn’t give her what she wanted, she would get really aggressive and all, but as I told a friend: I’ve had worst sex in my life with human beings,” he added, laughingly. Although Lebrewsky’s fiancé did not take so kindly to the news, he says she is happy that he is healthy and well and that she does not consider what happened as cheating, under these particular circumstances, and that their wedding plans are still scheduled for this summer.

"Pahala, HI | A scuba diver is being hospitalized at Ka’u hospital on the island of Hawaii after he inserted his penis into a giant clam while recreational diving.","Sean Madison, 22, was transported to Ka’u hospital after suffering from severe breathing complications, vomiting, extreme swelling and low blood pressure. Doctors believe physical contact with the giant mollusk may have triggered his allergy to seafood and exposed him to high levels of arsenic. Madison, 22, whose condition has stabilized, said he inserted his penis inside the clam as a prank to impress his friend, Thomas Meyer. The amateur diver also admitted he was still hung over from the night before and had consumed GHB and ecstasy, which impaired his judgment at the time. After eventually releasing himself from the clam, the young man later developed a severe allergic reaction and was rushed to Ka’u Hospital. Dr. Andrew Smith at Ka’u Hospital believes Madison’s body reacted to the digestive enzymes of the giant mollusk, which was possibly trying to digest the man’s genitals at the time of the incident. Dr. Smith admits it is the first case of its kind he has seen in his 22 years of practice. A fatal incident occurred at the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu in 2014 when an aquarium employee put his head inside a giant clam and lost consciousness before he could be rescued, confirming the local reputation of the mollusk as a ‘killer clam’.

After a minute or two, one of the officers pulled out a Taser gun and fired at Mr. Brown, instantly electrocuting everyone in the area. Six people were critically and 11 others suffer from light or serious injuries as the electric discharge affected everyone within 50 feet of Mr. Brown. The victims were rapidly transported to various hospitals across the city and, according to WTN-TV, all of them have now been stabilized.

"Langley, Virginia | A major explosion occurred last night at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, igniting a fire which almost completely destroyed an annex of the building and led to the discovery of a suspected drug lab.","The detonation took place around 11:30 pm last night. The powerful blast was heard for miles around the complex and sent plumes of black smoke into the air. The firefighters of the Langley City Fire-Rescue were rapidly mobilized on the site, where they fought the fire for almost six hours before they were finally able to extinguish the flames. While inspecting the building to secure the area, they found large quantities of chemicals and over-the-counter medications that are used to make meth and fentanyl. The firefighters transmitted the information to the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office (FCSO), which dispatched dozens of deputies and investigators on the scene. After conducting a search of the western wing of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, they found more than 2 tons of pure pseudoephedrine, as well as large quantities of acetone, iodine crystals, battery acid, drain cleaner, lantern fuel and antifreeze. The Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it had opened an investigation to determine if the site was an illegal drug lab and if the fire was caused by an illegal activity. More than 5 tons of drugs and 45 tons of chemicals were seized in the building which some deputies have described as an “industrial-scale drug lab”. This is not the first time that the CIA is accused of manufacturing and trafficking illegal drugs. While the CIA was sponsoring a Secret War in Laos from 1961 to 1975, it was accused of trafficking in opium. The CIA made its own internal inquiries of its staff and clients in Laos concerning the drug trade and admitted that small amounts of opium had been smuggled via their contract aircraft. Several local, state, and federal investigations have also taken place concerning the alleged use of the Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport as a CIA drop point in large scale cocaine trafficking beginning in the early 1980s. This is the first time, however, that drugs are seized on an official CIA installation, and the incident could have some very serious consequences for the organization which is already at odds with the new American President. Neither the White House or the CIA, have officially reacted yet, but many analysts expect Donald Trump to use this investigation as a pretext to cut the agency’s funding. I think the CIA and the UN both need to be dismantled and go away. The CIA as we know it today needs to be destroyed! They are evil and they are the DEEP STATE. CIA is the largest dealer in narcotics in the world. They have been doing this for many years and lots of people know about it and keep the secret.

Dr. Catherine Hersch was skeptical at first but further investigation led her to corroborate the family’s verdict The young girl told Dr. Hersch she had never participated in sexual intercourse and swore that her hymen was still intact, which was later confirmed by the doctor. “She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. It’s not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents, but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy, and she urged me to check her hymen, which I eventually did, and to my utter surprise, the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm” she assures. The young girl and her family have decided to keep the baby regardless of the atypical situation. “We are devout Christians. If God made this birth possible, then who are we to judge the how or the why?” she ponders. “If Joseph and Mary had not given birth to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, where would humanity be today?” she asks, a tear in her eyes. “We will soon have a new family member within our community, and it is a gift and a blessing”. “Vaccine technology is fairly recent in history so we hypothesize how they work, but as in this instance, why do some women fall pregnant from vaccines?” asks Ph.D. student Alexa Goldberg,  who is writing her doctoral thesis on the subject. “There is clearly a necessity to study this growing trend and further research is needed.

"Petersburg, KY | A leading paleontologist claims he has found evidence linking homosexuality and the extinction of the dinosaurs.","Anthony Othman, a renowned paleontologist and leading curator at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky,  firmly believes homosexuality, and not an asteroid colliding with Earth as is commonly believed, was the main cause of the disappearance of the dinosaurs more than 66 million years ago. “I’m not saying the asteroid that hit Earth didn’t kill many dinosaurs, I’m just saying it was definitely not the main cause,” he explains, visibly enthusiast when reached on the phone. “It is by studying the behavior of homosexual iguanas in the Galápagos islands that I first came to this conclusion over 25 years ago” he adds. Paleontologist Anthony Othman firmly believes homosexuality, and not an asteroid impact, was the main cause for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Dr. Othman argues that the practice of homosexuality in reptiles today is similar to the behavior of the dinosaurs and is defined by a particular gene which is easily shown when artificial selection is applied. “I took the semen of iguanas who showed a high tendency towards homosexuality and preferred the presence of same-sex mates » he acknowledges. « I then proceeded to impregnate female specimens of a small group of individuals,” he explains. “After three or four generations, the males, as well as the females of the species, lost all appetite for heterosexual behavior and the group, if not impregnated artificially, would not have survived beyond the fifth generation” he comments, visibly proud of his discovery. “Recent findings of massive numbers of velociraptor fossils in the region, all male, tend to prove my latest findings” he concludes. A 2014 Oxford University study showed that amongst amphibians, reptiles, and birds, homosexual behavior is fairly common. Mammals, on the contrary, were found to have a preference for heterosexuality, an evolutionary trait that might have given them a slight advantage in the long run, believe many experts. top scientist? more like GAY SCIENTIST Your email address will not be published.

To rid the young boy of evil Jinns (spirits) and teach him a lesson, the court of elders forced the young boy to marry the camel who recently gave birth, explained to reporters Mohammed Mulak, the village spokesman Although the young man has received a punishment that has shamed him and his family, friends and family members report that the young man is satisfied with the verdict. “He is very ashamed of his wrong doings but is very relieved to have learned that he is not the father of the calf,” his aunt told local reporters. “He says he felt he was not ready for such responsibilities and is very glad to put this behind him,” she told reporters. The local imam claims the young boy has been possessed by evil spirits and the marriage with the animal should ward off the bad omen brought by the insidious act. “It is necessary to cleanse this young boy of his evil actions and the marriage should protect him from evil Jinns (spirits) and bring forth Allah’s protection within this weak boy’s soul,” he explained. “May Allah protect him and his family,” he added.

Al-Rashidi’s employer first hesitated before calling the police but said he could not tolerate such an act of perversion before God and that his employee’s actions needed to be punished. “When I found him licking the camel’s penis, he first told me that he was drinking the sperm from the camel to cure his oral herpes infection,” his employer told the judge. Drinking camel urine is reputed to have many health benefits but sperm is not known to have any curative powers admit experts. Judge Muhammad El Fehdi expressed his moral disgust towards the young man, warning him that he had not only disgraced himself but his entire family before God. “How ashamed your father and mother must be and how much they must regret giving birth to a son who enjoys fondling the genitals of camels,” the judge said in court. Al-Rashidi’s parents also pleaded the judge to give their son a harsh punishment so as to deter him from repeating the offense. Under intense questioning from the judge, the defendant admitted that it was not his first offense but that he had taken part in such activities previously a number of times. “I don’t know why I did it. I knew it was wrong but I could not resist,” said the young man, bursting into tears. “You are a young man who is starting your life, and so I will give you a light punishment, but if you are to repeat this immoral and disgraceful practice, next time I will be less lenient,” the judge told the young man. Abdullah al-Rashidi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and two months in prison. According to Shariah law, in the case of bestiality, the animal becomes “unfit” and must be killed. He was also sentenced to pay SR 18,000 ($5,000 USD) to replace the worth of five of the camels he admitted having inappropriate relations with.

Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that the CIA invented the whole thing will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September 2016. Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists. He also claims to be in possession of CIA documents, linking the agency to many illegal activities. The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks. On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him. He has since threatened to release other documents in his possession, which he claims would be far more embarrassing for the American government than the ones he has already rendered public. It’s the UN, not the CIA. and the CIA tells the scientists of every other country in the world what to say ? and they all agree ? “He has since threatened to release other documents in his possession, which he claims would be far more embarrassing for the American government than the ones he has already rendered public.”

"Two men from the Canadian Atlantic Coast made an astonishing catch while fishing near the confluence of the Matane River and the St. Lawrence River. The fishermen captured a northern prawn measuring over 2.80 meters (9 ft) long and weighing more than 145 kilograms (319 lbs), the biggest crustacean of this type to have ever have been caught.","Rene Kirouac and his brother-in-law, Raymond Bergeron, were sailing aboard their trawl when they noticed some unusual movement along the rocks located near the coast. Upon approaching, they noticed that the movement was caused a giant shrimp, and they set out to capture the amazing creature. Realizing quickly that their fishing traps would be useless against a crustacean of this size, the two men rushed out of their hunting rifles to handle the huge animal. Biologists from the University of Quebec in Rimouski (UQAR) under the direction of Professor Denis Langevin were quickly dispatched to take measurements of the animal and conduct various analyzes. Marine biologist Denis Langevin believes that because of its size, the crustacean probably fed on seals and other marine mammals in order to survive. Prawns can normally grow to about 15 to 16 cm in length, and their average size is about 8 cm. They are carnivores that usually feeds of various forms of zooplankton and this is the first time a specimen of such a size is fished in Canada. The mystery remains whole as to the origin of the gigantic size of the crustacean. The Guinness Book of Records has confirmed this morning in a statement that it was both the longest and heaviest ever recorded shrimp. Photographers of the organization have also been dispatched to Canada to take pictures of the creature before it is sold and eaten. Sweet God, can you only imagine the size of cocktail you could make with that. Did they have a big enough pot to boil it in? How many cans of bay’s did it take? Slow boil so the outside isn’t tough? Machete to devein. And a crowbar to remove shell? Your email address will not be published.

"Houston, TX | A Texan teenager who has lost his eyesight because of his obsession with masturbation is reaching out to social media and warning others the risks of masturbation are just too high.","The 17-year-old man who has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) admits he could masturbate over 36 times a day before losing his eyesight. – Josh Turnip Frequent masturbation can accelerate age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, the most common cause of blindness in the Western World, explains Dr. Andrew Kramer at St. Luke’s Medical Center Although Josh Turnip knows most teens don’t indulge in masturbating as much as he did, he admits he hopes others will heed his warnings. “I started to have blurry vision, sometimes I would even pass out completely” he recalls, visibly emotional. “My doctors thought I had epileptic seizures. It is only when I turned almost completely blind that we realized what was the true cause of my fading eyesight,” he adds. “I just hope that by telling my story to the world I can prevent this from happening to other teens who think masturbating comes with no consequences,” he concludes. Doctors believe Josh’s condition could improve in the months to come and have noticed a slow recovery of visual functions since he has changed his habits.

"Varanasi | A retired cobbler from northern India, Mahashta Murasi, claims he was born in January 1835, making him not only the oldest man on earth but the oldest to have ever lived, according to the Guinness World Records.","According to Indian officials, the man was born at home in the city of Bangalore on January 6th, 1835, and is recorded to have lived in Varanasi since 1903. He worked as a cobbler in the city until 1957, when he retired at the already venerable age of 122. “I have been alive so long, that my great grand-children have been dead for years” explains Mr. Murasi. The man’s birth certificate and identity cards all seem to confirm his version, but unfortunately, no medical examination can confirm his saying for now. The last doctor Mister Murasi visited died in 1971, so there is little information available about his previous medical files.

An American tourist has met an untimely death in the Philippines after being accidentally killed by local fishermen reports the Manila Catholic Press this week.,"Andrew Stevens, 28, was accidentally harpooned to death multiple times by local fishermen who allegedly mistook Stevens for some kind of large fish. Stevens at the time was wearing a colorful mermaid tail which could explain the confusion believe authorities. Andrew Stevens, 28, met an untimely death after being stabbed a total of 127 times with harpoons and was found with a large hook in his left cheek, Manila authorities reported. It is only when the victim’s body was dragged upon the boat that the fishermen apparently realized the horror of what had just happened. “We have a long, long day of fishing with no fish that day. So we very happy when we catch him, maybe we too excited” one fisherman explained, visibly remorseful. The San Francisco Mermaid and Mermen community will commemorate Andrew Stevens’s death by an official gathering next week in the San Francisco Bay area.

"Waukegan, IL | The capture of a 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of hundreds of missing people in the region in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.","John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. “We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before we finally shot it and wounded it to the head” explains the Toronto resident on vacation. “Luckily, I had my rifle in hand, or else this prize fish would’ve never been caught” claims his friend, a long-time resident of Chicago, Allan Brooks. John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist and Toronto resident, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake yesterday The great white shark estimated at more than 1,5 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts. “Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region, but this is clearly the first occurrence of such a beast in the region that I can remember of” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters. Authorities suspect that more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time. Local campground owner, Robert Helm, says he had warned authorities about the series of disappearances to no avail “I’ve owned this campground for the past seventeen years” explains local entrepreneur, Robert Helm. “I’ve had my load of visitors disappearing mysteriously over the years, but I was told not to say anything about it. People would check in, but they wouldn’t check out,” he recalls. “Nobody ever believed me anyway and it would’ve scared away the tourists,” he told local reporters. “It would’ve been bad for business in town” he adds, visibly relieved since the capture of the large creature. U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Sidney Johnson reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems, dealing great damage to their kidneys and respiratory system. In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Erie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930. okay, now this is epic Hey check it out peeps, dont under estimate fish or animals or especially our government Hi That is mysterious… Damn.. this is like the 5th shark in 3 years! yes your right … Your email address will not be published.

A fisherman lost at sea for 14 days off the coast of Florida has been rescued by the United States Coast Guard this week.,"Alvin McCallister, 72, was found on a small rocky islet 200 miles off the nearest coastline where he shipwrecked two weeks ago and managed to survive off of several seagulls, mussels, and urchins. McCallister, for whom doctors do not fear for his life, was found suffering from intense hallucinations possibly caused by dehydration and the toxins of unidentified mussels he consumed on the small islet. McCallister who is presently suffering from mild hallucinations, told his brother, Timothy McCallister, that he survived with the help of mermaids who fed him but also allegedly took advantage of him sexually. McCallister, who is believed to have ingurgitated some form of toxin such as lead or mercury found in dangerous quantities in certain varieties of mussels he possibly consumed, is still under psychiatric evaluation. “Although Mr. McCallister does present abnormal injuries and inflammation to the genital and anal area, it is highly unlikely that he was sexually exploited or sodomized by living sea creatures and these are possibly self-inflicted” explained one medical expert. Although McCallister’s mental state is presently unstable, doctors believe he should heal completely in the weeks to come after his body has expurgated the dangerous levels of toxins he has been exposed to.
